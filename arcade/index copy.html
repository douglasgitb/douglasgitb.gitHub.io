<h3>Current status (April 2013):</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1j06Vbnjhg">Video</a> walkthrough! Also, the <a href="Quantum/IMG_4925.jpg">Quantum</a> repro PCB is currently playing well in the Tempest cab using an adapter PCB and temporary control panel - but can be swapped back to Tempest with no harm done.</p>
<p>Due to popular demand, we picked up a Spy Hunter to replace the one I gave away. Cabinet has been reglued, Cheap Squeak fixed, replaced PS caps to <s>eliminate</s> reduce hum and fixed loose ground wire to get the marquee lit. Still has this weird intermittent problem where the game will freeze with a black screen and then return (right where it stopped) and continue playing.</p>
<p>Carpet has been installed and the power outlets installed. Since there are no finished walls, the outlets for the games are installed in the ceiling, with two duplex outlets (4 games) per circuit. Eight foot extension cords  hang straight down along the wall behind the center of each game. This  omits clutter while still allowing the games to be pulled out for service (made simply by the installation of <a href="http://www.globalindustrial.com/p/material-handling/conveyors/ball-transfer/1-inch-carbon-steel-main-ball-with-two-hole-flange-carbon-steel-housing-2-inch-w">these</a> roller bearings)</p>
<p>Two flourescent shop lights  can be used to brightly light the room; but they are kept off most of the time. The <a href="lighting">lighting</a> plan was to have blacklights and RGB LEDs bouncing off a small disco ball... turns out the LED strips are so diffuse they do not work with a disco ball. Upon further, ah, reflection, I'm glad it didn't work out as we'll now go with a more subdued scheme where the lighting strips lie in an aluminum track and shine up to be bounced off the ceiling (shown as the eight-sided figure in the center). The controller allows for various color changing patterns (my favorite is the slow crossfade along the RGB spectrum) or keying off the ambient noise in the room (where frequency changes color and volume changes brightness - will have to test in the actual environment).</p>
<p> Almost all the games are home now - the entire top <a href="backrow.jpg">row</a> of (mostly vector)  games  as well as Championship Sprint, the Galaxian (which is a vertical multigame using the <a href="http://www.phoenixarcade.com/ArcadeSD.htm">ArcadeSD</a> board), and all three  cockpits. Star Wars did <a href="SW/IMG_4597.JPG">not fit</a> down the outer stairs even with the canopy removed... I carefully split the cab into two halves by removing the sill plates and base, peeling up the carpet, and cutting across the floor. Once both halves were inside, I screwed two beams inside the existing bracing in the floor cavity, reattached the base, and put the carpet back down. There is absolutely no visible sign it ever happened.  ST:TNG pinball went down in one piece (and now has the <a href="http://www.colordmd.com">Color DMD</a>!).</p>

<p>The Joust cabinet will be a Multi-Williams (converted back from Hydra) and the Power Drift/Outrun will be retrieved from loan this summer. Note there is room for Cyclone to return one day. Anyone have a SketchUp model for Omega Race or Star Trek cockpit?</p>
