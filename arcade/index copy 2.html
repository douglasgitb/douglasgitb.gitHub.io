<strong>Information and news about the Gauck boys' arcade and www.gauck.com arcade projects</strong>
<h3>Current status (September 2013):</h3>
<p>All the games have returned home, and were re-arranged to make way for the return of Cyclone. Sadly, the pinball deal fell through but the new arrangement yields some nice benefits. A few crucial inches were gained in the aisles, more room for the players at Two Tigers, and the light bulb went on for what to do with the vacant space left for the door swing. Just a bit tight between Power Drift and Omega Race if moving a game through that aisle, which could be solved by putting a shallower cab like Star Castle in that spot, but I can't bring myself to break up vector row.</p>
<p>Also upgraded the sound system to two pair of Boston Acoustics 745 speaker systems, hooked to an Apple Airport Express to stream audio. Quadrophenia!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1j06Vbnjhg">Video</a> walkthrough! Also, the <a href="Quantum/IMG_4925.jpg">Quantum</a> repro PCB is currently playing well in the Tempest cab using an adapter PCB and temporary control panel - but can be swapped back to Tempest with no harm done.</p>
<p>Due to popular demand, we picked up a Spy Hunter to replace the one I gave away. Cabinet has been reglued, Cheap Squeak fixed, replaced PS caps to <s>eliminate</s> reduce hum and fixed loose ground wire to get the marquee lit. Still has this weird intermittent problem where the game will freeze with a black screen and then return (right where it stopped) and continue playing.</p>
<p>Carpet has been installed and the power outlets installed. Since there are no finished walls, the outlets for the games are installed in the ceiling, with two duplex outlets (4 games) per circuit. Eight foot extension cords  hang straight down along the wall behind the center of each game. This  omits clutter while still allowing the games to be pulled out for service (made simply by the installation of <a href="http://www.globalindustrial.com/p/material-handling/conveyors/ball-transfer/1-inch-carbon-steel-main-ball-with-two-hole-flange-carbon-steel-housing-2-inch-w">these</a> roller bearings)</p>
<p>Two flourescent shop lights  can be used to brightly light the room; but they are kept off most of the time. The <a href="lighting">lighting</a> plan was to have blacklights and RGB LEDs bouncing off a small disco ball... turns out the LED strips are so diffuse they do not work with a disco ball. Upon further, ah, reflection, I'm glad it didn't work out as we'll now go with a more subdued scheme where the lighting strips lie in an aluminum track and shine up to be bounced off the ceiling (shown as the eight-sided figure in the center). The controller allows for various color changing patterns (my favorite is the slow crossfade along the RGB spectrum) or keying off the ambient noise in the room (where frequency changes color and volume changes brightness - will have to test in the actual environment).</p>
