<strong>Information and news about the Gauck boys' arcade and www.gauck.com arcade projects</strong>
<h3>Current status (July 2023):</h3>
<p>We moved across the country, so the arcade has been disbanded. We had some good times. All the games were sold and/or given away (or perhaps on long term loan?) with the exception of Major Havoc (now fully assembled in all its glory) and the Indiana Jones pinball which we brought with us.<p>
<h3>Previous status (up to circa 2022):</h3>
We moved to Philly, and some other stuff happened. Here is the new layout with some nice additions. Major Havoc needs assembly, and Sea Wolf needs repair. Otherwise all is well.</p>

<h3>Old news and links</h3>
<p>We are moving which will relieve the 'almost cramped' feeling but will take a while and impact time available for repairs and development of projects. On the other hand it means space for the latest addition, a very nice Twilight Zone pinball machine. Here are four possible layouts for the new space: <a href="new1.png">1</a>, <a href="new2.png">2</a>, <a href="new3.png">3</a>, <a href="new4.png">4</a>. Note there is also a Red Baron, which is being built from a Battlezone that came with the open face kit.</p>
<p>&quot;Final&quot; addition: The Addams Family pinball! Found a good local deal and after a few repairs (leaked battery-damaged traces jumpered for the switch matrix, resoldered broken off solenoid leads, replaced 22 bulbs and a DMD fuse) and a good cleaning she is playing well. Contemplating a few mods and the color DMD as well as switching to the Special Edition ROM. It fits in perfectly between Star Trek and Cyclone - both physically and in terms of game play complexity and style.</p>
<p>To fit, the back wall has reached maximum density, but there is still an inch or two between games. Aisles are at least 24&quot; wide so it's on the verge of feeling cramped - may flip the arrangement of the back row so the deeper games are by Cyclone (as <a href="layout7.png">before</a>).</p>
<p>We have Multi-Williams! I've tucked a switching PS and the old ArcadeShop board into a dedicated Stargate I've had loitering around here for a while. The sad Joust cabinet (still in garage covered with black paint from its Hydra conversion)  has no original parts left so it is the logical choice to  someday house the horizontal mulit-game (and the Stargate will revert to its own self). For now we are glad to be finally playing all those games, and feel like the arcade is complete!</p>
<p>Also upgraded the sound system to two pair of Boston Acoustics 745 speaker systems, hooked to an Apple Airport Express to stream audio. Quadrophenia!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1j06Vbnjhg">Video</a> walkthrough! Also, the <a href="Quantum/IMG_4925.jpg">Quantum</a> repro PCB is currently playing well in the Tempest cab using an adapter PCB and temporary control panel - but can be swapped back to Tempest with no harm done.</p>
<p>Due to popular demand, we picked up a Spy Hunter to replace the one I gave away. Cabinet has been reglued, Cheap Squeak fixed, replaced PS caps to <s>eliminate</s> reduce hum and fixed loose ground wire to get the marquee lit. Still has this weird intermittent problem where the game will freeze with a black screen and then return (right where it stopped) and continue playing.</p>
<p>Carpet has been installed and the power outlets installed. Since there are no finished walls, the outlets for the games are installed in the ceiling, with two duplex outlets (4 games) per circuit. Eight foot extension cords  hang straight down along the wall behind the center of each game. This  omits clutter while still allowing the games to be pulled out for service (made simply by the installation of <a href="http://www.globalindustrial.com/p/material-handling/conveyors/ball-transfer/1-inch-carbon-steel-main-ball-with-two-hole-flange-carbon-steel-housing-2-inch-w">these</a> roller bearings)</p>
<p>Two flourescent shop lights  can be used to brightly light the room; but they are kept off most of the time. The <a href="lighting">lighting</a> plan was to have blacklights and RGB LEDs bouncing off a small disco ball... turns out the LED strips are so diffuse they do not work with a disco ball. Upon further, ah, reflection, I'm glad it didn't work out as we'll now go with a more subdued scheme where the lighting strips lie in an aluminum track and shine up to be bounced off the ceiling (shown as the eight-sided figure in the center). The controller allows for various color changing patterns (my favorite is the slow crossfade along the RGB spectrum) or keying off the ambient noise in the room (where frequency changes color and volume changes brightness - will have to test in the actual environment).</p>

<p>Investigating retrofit <a href="http://www.gauck.com/arcade/tvex/tvex.png">boards</a> to  improve the quality of vectors (Jed Margolin's idea from <a href="http://www.jmargolin.com/vgens/vgens.htm#TomCat">Tomcat</a>: instead of turning the DAC reference on and off, the voltage from the DAC is connected to/disconnected from the integrator.)</p>
<p>Coming soon for the test bench: Space Duel to X <a href="http://www.gauck.com/arcade/adapters/SDtoX.png">adapter</a> board with built-in controls. Hooks up to a Space Duel harness, has spots on board for a full set of controls (up/down/left/right/button 1/button 2) for P1 &amp; P2 or trackball or dual analog stick with button 3. Add the relevant controls and solder the edge connector according to the target game's pinout and use it to run any Atari, SEGA or Midway color or B&amp;W vector game. Generates +12v and -5v for games like Star Wars from the Space Duel harness.</p>
<p> Battlezone Cabaret inner artwork <a href="http://www.gauck.com/arcade/BZ/BZ cab/">scans</a> - working on having it vectorized and repro art made.</p>
