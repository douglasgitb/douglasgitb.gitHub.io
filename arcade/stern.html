Still has control panel with joystick &amp; two buttons but no art. Monitor glass is there in overall good shape except some of the art was scraped away to fit the Mr. Do! card on the left. Marquee has some peeling / adhesive residue in the upper right corner.</p>		<p><a href="junk/Stern/back.jpg"><img src="junk/Stern/smback.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a> <a href="junk/Stern/bottom.jpg"><img src="junk/Stern/smbottom.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>		<p>Has monitor mounts, coin door and counter, plus speaker and PS remnants. Some delaminating along bottom edge but cabinet is solid. I put in a replacement plywood crosspiece and reglued joints throughout. I have a truck and so can help with transport around Baltimore area (and sometimes Philly).</p>	</body></html>
