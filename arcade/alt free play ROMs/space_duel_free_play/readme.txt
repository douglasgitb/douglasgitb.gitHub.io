Free Play with attract mode hack v1.0 for Atari Space Duel
by Pat Daderko (DogP)

To use this hack, burn this image to a 2532 (or other chip with appropriate adapter) and replace chip R1 (136006-201).  Set the DIP switches for 1 coin/1 credit (switches 7 and 8 off at B4), and Charge by game (switch 4 on at P10/11).

As always, use at your own risk... it seems to work fine for me, but I can't be held responsible for any consequences of your use.
