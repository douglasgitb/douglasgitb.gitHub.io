Later that day...

Version 2.0  
-----------

Just a quick little hack to allow having 6 bullets on screen
at one time in Asteroids.  It seems to work, but I've not
tested it much at all...

Known Issues:

1) When the game starts the first couple fire button hits 
   have no effect-- I suspect that bullet count is just 
   off because of the two extra "rounds" available.

I'm not sure if the extra bullets have an effect on overall 
game speed due to the extra collision detection.

I found and fixed a bug where the second wave would always 
start with ten Asteroids.  Seems OK now.

Anyway, it's something to play with.  Have fun!
