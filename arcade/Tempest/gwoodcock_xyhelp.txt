You can contact them via email at startech@cybernet.netor get them on the WWW at http://www.cybernet.net/web/startech/ or byphone at 609/654-5544.Before you ask, I do have a small cache of spare vector monitor partsranging from entire monitors, to individual PCBs, to discrete elements(like the HV transformer) for both color and black-and-white units (noAmplifone parts, though; sorry).  I am willing to sell or trade so justsend me some email or call me at 214.684.7380.  Also, please call mebefore you junk any vector stuff; I hate talking with operators andhearing, "I threw all that junk in the trash a few weeks/years ago!"  IfI can't get there to personally take it off your hands, I can make somecalls to friends around the world who will be able to.  There are quitea few of us nuts who just love these old vector games.Vector monitors, also referred to by Atari and others as "XY" (ick) or"Quadrascan" (double ick) monitors, are available in black and white orcolor.  A black and white picture tube has one electron gun that lightsjust one type of phosphor (usually, but not always, white).  Color tubeshave 3 electron guns that, when the yoke and neck magnets are alignedproperly, each hit their own phosphors only, either red, green, or blue(RGB).  Something called a shadow mask is used so each gun hits only oneset of phosphors.  There is no inherent difference between the tubesused in vector monitors and the tubes used in raster monitors; only thecontrol circuitry differs.  That is not to say that you can use any tubein any monitor; there are several different neck pinouts that have beenused for picture tubes so you have to find a tube with a matching pinoutfirst.  If you have a lot of screen burn, you can replace a color vectorpicture tube with any compatible "off-the-shelf" 100 degree in-linepicture tube that is also used in raster-scan displays.So far, this has been just basic TV stuff and it holds true for rastermonitors too.  Now we will diverge.  The electron guns in the neck ofthe tube emit a stream of electrons that bombard the face of the tubethat would hit dead center if not for the deflection magnets on the neckof the tube.  There are two deflection coils.  One for horizontaldeflection (X) and one for vertical deflection (Y) of the electron beam.Consider the center of the screen to be (0,0) volts to the deflectionmagnets.  If you want to move the beam to the right you put a positivevoltage on the horizontal deflection "X" coil (+,0).  A negative voltagemoves it to the left.  Up and down are accomplished with positive ornegative voltages to the vertical deflection (Y) coil.The deflection coils are driven with the same kind of circuitry someaudio amplifiers use.  Imagine that the game puts out pre-amp analoglevels and that the monitor amplifies and displays the output.  Thereare some vector monitors (the ones used in the Cinematronics games) thatare digital in nature and have a significantly different design.  Do notassume that anything discussed in this document applies to thesemonitors since much of it does not.The third section is what (at least by Atari) is called the "Z"amplifier which controls the brightness.  There is a "Z" amplifier foreach electron gun which means that black and white monitors have onlyone "Z" amp and color monitors have three.To draw an asteroid or other object the game shuts off the Z amp (oramps) and applies the correct vector information to the X and Yamplifiers driving the deflection coils to move the beam to the desiredlocation.  Then the appropriate Z amp(s) are turned on to illuminate thescreen and the vectors are modified to draw an outlined asteroid.  Onmost monitors you can turn the brightness up to the point where the Zamp(s) don't completely shut down and you can see the full path of theelectron beam as it flies around.  The designers of Star Wars exploitedthese traces when laying out the dots for the starfield pattern and theDeath Star explosion to form "connect-the-dot" messages that say, "MAYTHE FORCE BE WITH YOU" on odd waves from 1 to 31 and, "HALLY MARGOLINRIVERA AVELLAR VICKERS DURFEY" (the last the names of the programmersand other people involved with making the game) on even waves from 2 to30 and on all waves from 32 to 99.What I have described so far applies to all vector monitors.  Knowinghow these things work helps greatly in trouble-shooting.  For instancedeflection of the beam to the edges of the screen puts the greateststrain on the X/Y deflection circuits so if you monitor has problems atthe edges, something is weak in that area.  The monitors make their ownpositive and negative DC from AC inputs so a reasonable thing to checkwould be the power supplies.  One of the main root causes of colorvector monitor problems is game lockups causing the monitor to goextended periods with no input signal which fries it in short order.The 2 main problems I have seen for game board lockups are bad solderjoints on the inter-board connectors (mainly Tempest) and also noisypower supplies.  I suggest that you replace the power supply filter capswith 105 degree Celsius capacitors instead of 85 degree ones; the highertemperature caps last much longer and are more stable.Vector monitors are also fussy about the quality of certain transistors.The X and Y deflection circuits are very much like audio amplifiers andtend to be hard on the big transistors used in the final stages ofamplification.  The Atari vectors use a push/pull rearrangement with NPNand PNP transistors for both the horizontal and vertical amps.  If youlose one of these transistors, you lose deflection in 1 of 4 directionsdepending on which transistor goes out.There is another circuit in the Atari stuff that is very importantcalled the spot killer.  What the spot killer does is shut down the Zamp(s) if the X or Y circuits go bad enough to cause the beam to fail tomove around the screen enough to keep from burning the phosphors aroundthe zero axes.  The phosphors will become permanently damaged if thebeam stays in one place for too long.  When the spot killer is active ared LED on the deflection board lights.  The spot killer also lights ifthe logic board does not supply the low level X and Y signals for themonitor to amplify or if the voltage supply for amplification is notpresent so it does not always indicate a monitor failure.Atari used 2 different (but pinout compatible) versions of the colorvector monitor.  The first and most unreliable was the Wells-Gardner.The second (used only in Star Wars and dedicated Major Havoc machines asfar as I know) was the Amplifone.  There were several versions of theAmplifone, early ones used in Quantum, and later ones used in Star Warshave differing tube/yoke numbers.  I'm assuming they are all compatiblebut don't know for certain?  Another quick aside; all the boards andprofessionally produced documents spell the company name correctly as"Amplifone" but lots of supplemental documentation (such as the documentbelow) misspell it as "Ampliphone".  I use whichever spelling was usedin the particular document presented.Each monitor design has a slightly different electrical characteristicand tube shape that will cause games designed for use with the Amplifoneto bulge out around the edges (a defect known as "barreling") when usinga Wells-Gardner and similarly will cause games designed for use with theWells-Gardner monitor to cleave inward around the outer edges (a defectknown as "pincushioning") when using an Amplifone.  It is quite minorand is really only noticeable when in the self-test screen as this drawsa (perfectly straight) bounding box around the edge of the display whichmakes it easy to notice.The Amplifone uses a neck socket the same as most other (non-vector)monitors from most other manufacturers use but the Wells-Gardner uses adifferent socket.  The pinout, however, is the same so you just need toconvert them if you want to switch tubes between the 2 types.  If youare careful, you should be able to pull off the plastic neck socketsfrom the each tube as they are just glued on over the glass.  Then justswap them.  For example, an Amplifone tube will work in a Wells-Gardnerchassis just fine (some versions of the Amplifone manual would lead youto believe they won't but that mistake was corrected in later versionsof the manual) except that the display will bulge in the outer-middlesslightly.  This bulging is due to differences in the yokes and *might*be counteracted by swapping the yokes (putting the Wells-Gardner yoke onthe transplanted Amplifone tube) but I haven't tried that yet.  If youhappen to run across a tube cross-reference chart, please let me knowwhat it says about RCA picture tube 19VLUP22 (the Wells-Gardner tube)and Rauland tube M48AAWOOX (the Amplifone tube).It is pretty easy to check to see if your tube is bad (it doesn't happena lot but it does happen).  Pins are counted counter-clockwise startingat the gap (when looking at the backside of the tube).  Pins 9 and 10are at either end of the heater element.  If you want to be absolutelycertain about which pin is which, check the socket on your neck board(it should number all the pins).  The heater is basically a very lowwattage light bulb that emits the electrons which are shot at thephosphor to make light.  You should read a short (OK, not a short but aVERY low resistance) across pins 9 and 10 if your heater is OK.  If youread an open, your tube is toast and there is nothing you can do (yourlight bulb is burned out).  If your heater is OK, check to make surethat the heater pins are not shorted to any of the emitter cathodes(pins 6, 8, and 11).  If you see a short then your tube has a seriousproblem but in many cases the short can be burned away.  Call your localTV repair shop to see if they can "rejuvenate" it.Here is the complete pinout of the neck/tube. 1 - G3 (focus grid) 2 - not used 3 - not used 4 - not used 5 - G1 (control grid) 6 - G (green cathode) 7 - G2 (screen grid; brightness) 8 - R (red cathode) 9 - H (heater)10 - H (heater)11 - B (blue cathode)Here is the complete pinout of the main connector (on the deflection board): 1 - Red input (4.0V full on;  1.0V black level) 2 - Green input (4.0V full on; 1.0V black level) 3 - Blue input (4.0V full on; 1.0 black level) 4 - Red GND (twisted pair with Red input) 5 - Green GND (twisted pair with Green input) 6 - Blue GND (twisted pair with Blue input) 7 - X input (16V Peak-to-Peak; 2.5Kohms) 8 - Y input (12V Peak-to-Peak; 2.5Kohms) 9 - Not Used (Key)10 - X GND (twisted pair with X input)11 - Y GND (twisted pair with Y input)12 - Power GND13 - 25V RMS14 - Power GND15 - 25V RMSSPECIAL NOTE:  The 2nd printing of TM-183 has a typo in Figure 8 on page11 which incorrectly identifies the heater as existing on pins 5 and 6.Strangely enough, both the 3rd and the 1st printings have the correctnumbers; go figure.I should also mention that the monitor Sega used in it's vector games(Electrohome's G08-CB0) is also an analog monitor and can be used in anyAtari vector game (and vice-versa) with the proper adaptors to mate thedifferent wiring harnesses (connectors) plus some circuitry to scale thevoltage ranges of the analog signals and the AC supply.  I do not havedocumentation for the G08-CB0 so I cannot say exactly what scaling isrequired but I can tell you that I have seen G08-CB0 monitors with"Tempest" burned into them and I also saw a Wells-Gardner with "SpaceFury" burned into it.  I have talked to several people who claim to haveseen such a setup in action but they have no specifics.  I wouldappreciate any details anybody can provide about the G08-CB0 and/or thespecific conversion details (either direction).David Shuman <essayes@telerama.lm.com> had this to say about theG08-CB0:  Sega XY monitors are analog monitors like the Atari XY's.Unlike the Atari XY's, the Sega XY's don't have a "Z" channel.  Theconnector from the game board to the monitor has only six connections:R, G, B, X, Y, and GND.  The G08, unfortunately, is a thoroughlyscrewed-up design.  The original G08 was apparently an operator'snightmare, often consuming itself in flames.  Sega started shippingrevised monitors with some hacks added, presumably to improvereliability.  The result didn't work too well either, and it lookedlike Frankenstein's monster with parts hanging off everywhere, gobs ofglue, soldered connections where detachable connectors are required,etc.  In the first two months I had my Eliminator, I had to fix themonitor twice.  And since you can't disconnect the HV board from themain board, you have to be very careful not to twist and yank out thewires as you make your repairs.  Picking off factory-installed globs ofglue to access blown parts is no fun either.I know this is supposed to be about Atari monitors but here is someinformation the Sega color vector monitors that I found on page 12 ofthe November 1981 issue of the Star*Tech journal.  I'll include it herejust in case you have one of those hybrid setups mentioned above.  Ifanybody knows more about the redesign that is mentioned, please let meknow!================================================================================"SPACE FURY" COLOR (G-80) X-Y SYSTEM REDESIGNGremlin/Sega reports that all of the problems encountered with theindustry's first color X-Y game "Space Fury" have been identified andsolved [yeah, right].The problems are centered around [ack, bad puns, too!]  the deflection(X-Y) amps.  Underrated power transistors combined with an extended "on"time during the power-up routine resulted in damaging the amplifiercircuit.The remedy includes a modification to the card cage and replacement ofthe Electrohome Monitor with a redesigned unit.Gremlin/Sega will have replaced all defective monitors and modified allgame card cages by the end of October.Initial field fixes did not resolve the problem entirely andGremlin/Sega decided to undertake the monitor replacement program.Electrohome, the monitor manufacturer, will replace monitors in theEastern U.S., while Gremlin/Sega will handle the Western U.S.For further details contact your distributor.================================================================================The Amplifone was commissioned as a replacement to the infamous,failure-prone Wells-Gardner.  Unfortunately it had a horrendouslyunreliable Achilles' heel; the HV transformer.  This part is widely (butfalsely) believed to be impossible to replace because there are no moreHV transformers around.  Fortunately, this is incorrect and they arereadily available, even though they are a bit expensive.NOTE:  [Ob-anally-retentive-pet-peeve] This part is commonly butimproperly referred to as the "flyback" transformer.  This is a misnomerbecause the flyback transformer exists only in raster monitors'deflection circuits.  Part of a flyback's duty is to regulate thecurrents necessary to make the electron beam "fly back" to the left (ortop) during retraces.  In vector monitors, the high voltage transformeris a "flyback" transformer in the sense that it is constructed anddesigned just like the flyback transformer in a raster monitor with theexception that the flyback portion (the horizontal deflection coil) isnot needed and so is not present.  There is an oscillator circuit thatserves the purpose that the horizontal oscillator would in a rastermonitor, and there is a power transistor that would be called ahorizontal output transistor if it were in a raster monitor, but thepart of the transformer that controls the retrace (flyback) is notpresent so there is no true flyback transformer in a vector monitor.  Ifyou must give it a name, use "HV" or "horizontal driver" instead of"flyback".As soon as Atari heard about all the failures of the HV transformers,they commissioned a third party to supply them with a ton ofreplacements for the Amplifone monitors since they were so unreliableand in such high demand.  Unfortunately (for Atari), by the time theywere manufactured, nobody cared anymore (because the games that used theAmplifone were getting old and starting to be retired/converted anywayor else they had Wells-Gardner retrofits in them) so this fact is notwidely known to most people in the industry.The replacement HV transformer was over-engineered to the max so that itwould not fail as much as the original part and to date Atari reportsthat THEY HAVE NOT HAD EVEN ONE REPORT OF THE REPLACEMENT EVER FAILING!To be critical, this could be due to the fact that by the time thereplacements became available, most people were no longer routing theirStar Wars machines (or at least not with the Amplifone monitors inthem).  Any machines being repaired and used today are likely to getgentle home use which naturally lengthens the life of the monitor andits parts.If your HV is dead then it is probably either resistor R12 near the HVtransformer or the HV transformer itself.  CHECK THE RESISTOR FIRSTsince it is much easier and cheaper to replace.  Simply unsolder it andsee if it has the proper resistance (2.2K Ohms).The catch is that Atari replacement parts are only supplied at thewholesale level to official Atari game distributors.  To find out thedistributor closest to you so that you can order this part from them,call Atari at 408.434.3700 and give them you Zip or Area Code and theywill give you a business name and phone number.  I am pretty sure theMSRP is about $160 but that is significantly cheaper than buying aWells-Gardner retrofit that you will have to repair about once a year(most distributors discount such old parts below the MSRP so youshouldn't have to pay that much especially if you comparison shop andplay the distributors off each other).Starting with some information I provided to get him started, Tim Tewalt<tewalt@peaks.ENET.dec.com> in mid-1995 attempted to bypass Atari andthe distributors by buying factory direct.  Here is what he discovered:================================================================================Hi guys; bad news.  The bottom line is $150 each when ordering a totalof 25 flybacks.  As Gregg Woodcock pointed out, Penn Trans of WingatePA, is no longer in business; hell, there's no such thing as Wingate,PA, either for that matter.  I called the Postmaster in Bellefonte, PAand found that Wingate was swallowed up by Bellefonte and moreimportantly, Penn Trans was bought out by Wintron Inc.  The part number926862802 from my flyback, matches the Wintron flyback part number, so Iwas pretty sure I had found the source.  They faxed me a quote a fewdays later with a price of $173.13 each on a quantity of ten and $149.83each on a quantity of twenty-five.  *NOT* the deal I was looking for.So anyway, I have decided not to pursue this any further.  If someoneelse would like to look into this, you'll find some pertinentinformation below.  Thanks a lot for your interest, guys.  Sorry Iwasn't able to come through."Flyback" Transformer for Amplifone XY monitor   Atari part number: A201005-01   Type number: 926862802 ("Transformer Multiplier")   Manufactured by: WinTron Inc.   Address: 250 Runville Road; Bellefonte, PA 16823   Phone: (814) 355-1521   FAX: (814) 355-1524[NOTE:  The reason for the high prices is that they do not have anystock on hand and would have to retool the machinery to manufacture afresh batch.

This part was available in inexhaustible quantitiesfrom Atari until recently but now Atari claims they have no more.  Isuspect that with all the reorganizations of the company some of the"dead weight" inventory was liquidated or thrown out altogether.  If youmake enough phone calls to large distributors, you should be able tolocate one.  If you do, please let me know and I'll add the informationto this document.  One person reported that when his HV transformer wentbad it took VR1, R20, and CR5 with it so you may want to test/replacethese parts, too (they are commonly available).Here is the document that describes how to install an Amplifone HVtransformer.  Thanks to Keith Jarett (keith@tcs.com) for mailing me aphotocopy (who in turn wishes to thank Mark Sherman and Al Vernon ofAtari Games for their fabulous in-depth knowledge and tech support.  Iagree; these guys have helped me a few times, too, and are fantastic).================================================================================[NOTE:  To my knowledge, Atari never bothered to copyright theseinstructions and they are not marked with a copyright symbol.]     INSTALLING THE NEW AMPLIPHONE [sic] HIGH VOLTAGE TRANSFORMER     ------------------------------------------------------------1. Remove the defective flyback from the highvoltage [sic] P.C.B.   [NOTE:  The new transformer has a black case and it is smaller than   the original which has a red case]2. Change R12 to a 1K ohm [1/4 Watt] resistor.  [NOTE:  recommended for   durability; not strictly required]3. Secure the new flyback to the high voltage pcb using the mount hole,   tighten nut on the circuit side of the High Voltage P.C.B.  [NOTE:   It bolts through the PCB, though you will have to first:     - enlarge the through hole slightly     - connect the wires from the transformer to the PCB     - tape over the PCB to insulate the traces from the metal bottom       of the transformer]4. Solder the thick BLACK wire from the HV transformer to the TOP   connector on the Focus block.5. Feed all six color coded wires from the bottom of the HV transformer   through the 2nd hole to the circuit side of the high voltage pcb.6. a. Solder GRAY wire to the point labeled Filament. (see picture below)      [NOTE:  This is where the "extra" wire from the old flyback went.]   b. Solder ORANGE wire to [former] pin 1.      [NOTE:  The photocopy I got with my replacement had the label for      this pin cut off!  It is the pin that goes to the case of Q3.]   c. Solder GREEN wire to [former] pin 4.   d. Solder BLACK wire to [former] pins 6 & 7.   e. Solder YELLOW wire to [former] pin 8.   f. Solder RED wire to [former] pin 9.   [NOTE:  Pin numbers are shown on the white plastic bottom of the old   transformer and on the schematic if you have one; for this reason, I   will not attempt to draw in the picture mentioned in (a)][A picture showing a full scale drawing of the solder side of the HVPCB, has been omitted for obvious reasons.  It does not show anythingthat cannot be derived from the included text; it was merely a "visualaid".][NOTE:  End of document; here is further advice from the Atari techs...]After you finish, you will need to adjust brightness (bottom pot on thewhite module).  Use the self test screen for this.  Also adjust focus.If nothing happens, the other (lower) focus wire is broken like mine was[NOTE:  Mine was broken, too!].  Take off the rubber cap to verify.Focus is the top pot on the white module.  This connection is fragileand takes a lot of heat/current so it frequently breaks off.Adjust R7 (the frequency of the primary switching) to get a video B+ of180 volts.  According to Mark, this will give the correct HV.  You don'treally need to tweak R17 as described in the manual if you know thatyour overvoltage protection cutoff is working OK.  Recheck focus aftertweaking R7.If any problems occur, verify that the +24 and -24 volt regulators arereasonably close to the correct output voltages.  Some departure is OKif you have the 5 watt resistors bridging their inputs and outputs(these are present to relieve the load under transient conditions suchas the all-white death star explosion).The board should now run MUCH cooler.  I can comfortably touch all theHV heat sinks which was not true before.================================================================================One word of caution about replacing the HV transistor (note that I said"transistor", *NOT* "transformer"; we are shifting gears); double checkthe part that you receive BEFORE you install it.  Why?  Here is atranscription of a note I found tucked in a Star Wars manual which alsomentions how to tell if your HV transformer is (probably) bad, where tomount a fan to lengthen its life, and a possible way to tell if yourtube is bad.  I have no idea where it came from:================================================================================ATARI STAR WARS HIGH-VOLTAGE BOARDby Avery Petty   A.P. Engineering   Huntington Beach, CARecently, I repaired a whole fleet of Atari STAR WARS.  I sent someoneto the distributor to get the 'hard-to-find' high voltage transistorBU406D [NOTE:  The transistor he is talking about Q3 labeled as "NPN7-Amp.  400V Power Transistor" in the manual's parts list.].  He cameback with a BU406, no "D".  The "D" must appear on the transistor.  Itmeans there is a high voltage diode in the package.  So beware, even thedistributor can goof!What will it cost you?  Your game maybe.  Without the diode, using theBU406, the high voltage will work for awhile [sic], but will burn up theflyback transformer which cost [sic] $90.00 [NOTE:  *much* more thanthat now]!If you are repairing a High Voltage board, and after replacing all thecapacitors, the two 24 volt regulators, and related parts and the highvoltage transistor with a BU406D, and you still don't have high voltage,and don't know why, you can be sure it's your flyback transformer.  Ifin doubt, pull it out and put it in a working STAR WARS and see, it willonly take 5 minutes [NOTE:  this is a severe under-estimate; I'd say itis at least a 15 minute job not including swapping them back if thatneeds to be done, but then again he is a professional and I am just ahack :>].When you finally fix it, put a fan under the board -mounted [sic] on thewood rail the board is mounted on, blowing on the High Voltage board.This is something that should be done to all STAR WARS, because theflyback is the most expensive part there [NOTE:  advice to be heeded forall Atari color vector games].If your high voltage won't get up to at least 19,000 volts, you may havea bad tube.  Look for real [sic] bad phosphor burn or a color missing.================================================================================Here is some text from the Major Havoc conversion kit installationinstructions (TM-268).

Modify the Wells-Gardner        |          | Deflection PCB" [found later in this document].      |          +------------------------------------------------------+Perform the following procedure to modify the Amplifone Deflection PCB(see Figure 8).   1.  Set the Deflection PCB on a clean work surface.   2.  Connect two type-1N754A Zener diodes together, anode to anode,       as shown in Figure 6 [found later in this document].  Use a       soldering iron to solder the two anode leads together.   3.  Connect two type-1N756A Zener diodes together and solder as       described in step 2.   4.  On the component side of the Deflection PCB, locate the yellow       wire connected to resistor R1 (left center of the PCB).   5.  Solder one cathode lead of the two type-1N754A Zener diodes       (soldered together in step 2) to the yellow wire on the soldered       side of the Deflection PCB as shown in Figure 8.   6.  Solder the other cathode lead of the two type-1N754A Zener diodes       to the nearest ground on the PCB as shown in Figure 8.   7.  On the component side of the Deflection PCB, locate the orange       wire connected to Resistor R24 (right center of the PCB).[Figure 8, entitled "Modifying the Amplifone Deflection PCB", showing afull scale picture of the solder side of the Deflection PCB, has beenomitted for obvious reasons.  It does not show anything that cannot bederived from the included text; it was merely a "visual aid".]   8.  Solder one cathode lead of the two type-1N756A Zener diodes       (soldered together in step 3) to the orange wire on the soldered       side of the PCB as shown in Figure 8.   9.  Solder the other cathode lead of the two type-1N756A Zener       diodes to the nearest ground on the PCB as shown in Figure 8.  10.  On the soldered side of the Deflection PCB, solder the cathode       lead of a type-1N4002 diode to the emitter of transistor Q17 as       shown in Figure 8.  11.  Scrape away the green protective coating at a convenient point on       the PCB, and solder the anode lead of the type-1N4002 diode to       the collector of transistor Q17 as shown in Figure 8.  12.  On the soldered side of the Deflection PCB, solder the anode lead       of a type-1N4002 diode to the emitter of transistor Q16 as shown       in Figure 8.  [NOTE:  This is the opposite of what you did in       step 10.]  13.  Scrape away the green protective coating at a convenient point on       the PCB, and solder the cathode lead of the type-1N4002 diode to       the collector of transistor Q16 as shown in Figure 8.  14.  On the soldered side of the Deflection PCB, solder the cathode       lead of a type-1N4002 diode to the emitter of transistor Q7 as       shown in Figure 8.  [NOTE:  This is the opposite of what you did       in step 12.]  15.  Scrape away the green protective coating at a convenient point on       the PCB, and solder the anode lead of the type-1N4002 diode to       the collector of transistor Q7 as shown in Figure 8.  16.  On the soldered side of the Deflection PCB, solder the anode lead       of a type-1N4002 diode to the emitter of transistor Q6 as shown       in Figure 8.  [NOTE:  This is the opposite of what you did in       step 14.]  17.  Scrape away the green protective coating at a convenient point on       the PCB, and solder the cathode lead of the type-1N4002 diode to       the collector of transistor Q6 as shown in Figure 8.================================================================================Here is an Atari Field Service bulletin courtesy of Al Kossow(aek@haxrus.apple.com) which describes modifications to the Amplifonemonitor to make it more robust.  All the diagnostic/repair stuff is newand compatible but the rest seems to be similar to part of the previousMajor Havoc documentation upgrade but they do differ in some respects.I would advise that you only implement 1 of them unless you are surethey are compatible (I am not).  If anybody knows if any are compatible(or not), let me know.  For now, I am listing them asmutually-exclusive; mix at your own risk.  I'd take the time and hassleto do the first one even though it is a lot more work.================================================================================[NOTE:  To my knowledge, Atari never bothered to copyright these fieldservice bulletins and they are not marked with a copyright symbol.]TECH TIP from the ATARI FIELD SERVICE DEPARTMENTSTAR WARS *Atari Color X-Y Display Deflection PCBYou should do the following modifications to help prevent the DeflectionPCB from failing.  THIS MODIFICATION SHOULD ONLY BE PERFORMED BY AQUALIFIED TECHNICIAN.Parts List----------------------------------------------------Quantity   Description                    Part No.----------------------------------------------------   6       Type-1N4002 Diode              31-1N4002   2       Type-1N754A 6.8V Zener Diode   131002-001   2       Type-1N756A 8.2V Zener Diode   32-1N756A   2       12 Ohm 5% 1/4 W resistor       110000-120   1.  Connect the two 1N754A Zener diodes together as shown in Figure       1.  The connection is made as follows:  bend the anode ends of       both diodes into a "fish-hook" pattern.  Hook the two fish-hooked       leads together, and solder them.  Remember that too much heat       will destroy the semiconductor material.   2.  Connect the two 1N756A Zener diodes together as shown in Figure       1.  Use the same technique as described in Step 1 above.   3.  Remove diode CR2 and solder in a type-1N4002 diode in its place.       [NOTE:  On older monitors, CR2 is labeled D602.]   4.  Remove diode CR11 and solder in a type-1N4002 diode in its place.       [NOTE:  On older monitors, CR11 is labeled D702.]   5.  Remove resistor R12 and solder in a 12 Ohm, 1/4W resistor in its       place.  [NOTE:  On older monitors, R12 is labeled R609.]   6.  Remove resistor R35 and solder in a 12 Ohm, 1/4W resistor in its       place.  [NOTE:  On older monitors, R35 is labeled R709.]   7.  Find the Y-Deflection Circuit (upper left area of the schematic).       Resistor R1 has two leads to it.  Find the lead that goes to the       yellow wire.  Connect this lead to the cathode of one of the       type-1N754A diodes.  Connect the cathode of the other type-1N754A       diode to ground.   8.  Find resistor R24.  It has two leads:  one runs to an orange       wire.  Connect this lead to the cathode of one of the type-1N756A       diodes.  Connect the cathode of the other type-1N756A diode to       ground.   9.  Find the type-2N3792 transistor Q17.  You will be installing a       type-1N4002 diode across the transistor's emitter and collector.       Solder the cathode lead of the type-1N4002 diode to the emitter,       and solder the anode to the collector of this transistor.  10.  Find the type-2N3617 transistor designated Q16.  You will be       installing a type-1N4002 diode across the transistor's emitter       and collector.  Solder the cathode lead of the type-1N4002 diode       to the collector, and solder the anode to the emitter of this       transistor.  [NOTE:  this is the opposite of what you did in Step       9.]  11.  Find the type-2N3792 transistor Q7.  You will be installing a       type-1N4002 diode across the transistor's emitter and collector.       Solder the cathode lead of the type-1N4002 diode to the emitter,       and solder the anode to the collector of this transistor.  12.  Find the type-2N3716 transistor Q6.  You will be installing a       type-1N4002 diode across this transistor's emitter and collector.       Solder the cathode lead of the type-1N4002 diode to the collector       and solder the anode to the emitter of this transistor.

The wordsPRINCESS LEIA'S REBEL FORCE will start to flutter and then worsen to anup-and-down movement of about 1/8 inch.  In its worst state, the scoreswill also move back and forth.   Solution:  Change the 10K Ohm resistor R83 on the Vector-GeneratorPCB to a 20K Ohm resistor.STAR WARS Color X-Y Display [Amplifone ONLY; not Wells-Gardner models!]Zero-Ohm Resistor Jumpers   Problem:  The *brown* zero-ohm jumpers (W1 or W2) on the DeflectionPCB open up on the High-Voltage PCB.  Zero-ohm resistors look likeregular resistors, but are marked on the PCB assembly and the schematicwith a W followed by a number.   Solution:  Replace the jumpers with pieces of wire.  Note that the/white/ and /tan/ jumpers are good and don't have to be replaced.Capacitor Failure   Problem:  Capacitors C3 and C4 on the High-Voltage PCB may bedefective.  These are rated at 100uF, 35V.   Solution:  Change C3 and C4 to 220uF, 35V with a low E.S.R.(Effective Series Resistance) rating.  The Atari part no. is123009-227.  The following manufacturers' capacitors will also work:Illinois Capacitor, part no. 227 RMR 050M (50V)Nichicon, part no. UPA1V221M (35V)[NOTE:  Digi-Key also sells "HFS SERIES Low Impedance" capacitors whichwill work.  Dial 800.DIGIKEY and order part number P1339; my lastcatalog (April 1994) lists them for $1.68 each.  The Nichicon capacitorsshould be obtainable from TTI.  TTI is the nations largest distributorof passive components such as resistors and capacitors.  Dial800.CALL.TTI to place an order.]* (c) 1983 Lucasfilm, Ltd. and Atari, Inc.

The positive and negative 24 voltsare present.Solution:  Check transistor Q3.  The problem may be that the transistortab (collector) may not be making good contact with the heat sink.Problem:  The schematics for the HV cutoff circuit do not match theboard assembly.Solution:  There are three board revisions.  You can tell which one youhave from the table here.  The schematics for all three boards areshown.   DISPLAY REVISION INDICATORS---------------------------------------------PCB Revision   R16        R18---------------------------------------------Original       470 Ohms   27K OhmsFirst rev.

It should be labeled a 1N751Azener diode.  The rating of 5.1 volts is correct, however.Problem:  On the HV PCB, the output voltage of the regulator is goodwhen the pin is lifted, but there is no voltage when the pin isconnected back to the board.Solution:  Check for bad 0.1uF glass capacitor across the voltageregulator.  The decoupling capacitor may be shorted.Problem:  The 24-volt regulator has failed.Solution:  Check for cracking around the regulator leads on the PCB.Also check for cracking around the leads of C3 and C4.Problem:  The voltage is low on the supply lines on either theDeflection PCB or the HV PCB.Solution:  There are jumpers on the supply lines of both boards.  Thejumpers are marked with a "W" on the schematic.  They look likeresistors on the board and have a single black band on them.  Thejumpers should have no resistance.  However, the brown jumpers may havecreated some resistance to them.  They should be replaced with a pieceof wire.  The white and tan jumper should have no problems.Problem:  The picture shrinks in from the negative X and Y sides of thescreen.Solution:  On some deflection boards, R35 and R12 may have a 15 Ohmresistor and a 30 Ohm resistor in parallel to get 10 Ohms.  If thesecome loose, then some picture shrinkage may occur.================================================================================Unfortunately that's all I have for the Amplifone.  It is worth notingthat I recently acquired a copy of the Empire Strikes Back manual whichincludes the previous tech tip (2 sections above) in a condensed formthat is mostly the same (it advocates replacing C3 and C4 as a matter ofcourse, rather than waiting for them to cause a problem).  Now I'll talkabout specifics and what devices I often find bad in the Wells-Gardnercolor vector monitor.  If you don't have a manual for this monitor, geta copy, as it does a good job of explaining how each section works andalso how to adjust it.For you people who don't like reading manuals, or who don't feel likelocating local sources for specific parts or who don't want to huntthrough a huge catalog to put together part numbers for an order, youcan order everything you (probably) need (except for the upgrade partsand the extra capacitor for P329 versions of the HV unit) bundledtogether in one package from ZANEN ELECTRONICS.  I suggest you order acouple of these to keep as spares since you never know when you mightneed to do a rush repair job and the price simply cannot be beat.Call them at 806.793.6337 and ask for "get well kit #206" which at lastcount had 30 pieces including all the capacitors that go bad, 6replacement chassis transistors, several of the smaller transistors (andtheir corresponding resistors), several diodes (including ZD902), andalso (rather sparse) documentation on how to replace the parts.  Pleasebe careful if you decide to replace R918 (25K potentiometer) in the HVunit; it needs to start out adjusted to an in-circuit resistance of 5.5Kwhen testing the upper 2 contacts of the 3.  (this is the average ofwhat I find to be the normal adjustment range which is always between 5Kand 6K.  If you have it maxed out you will probably damage your unitwhen you turn it on.  I'm not sure why the kit includes this part asI've never come across a bad one yet.Ordering a kit from them also entitles you to FREE technical assistanceand they seem to be very experienced and knowledgeable.  They takecredit cards and do not charge anything for UPS shipping (< 7 days).You can tell them Gregg sent you if you want.  As of December 1994, theprice for this kit was $14.95 which is probably cheaper than any dealyou could put together yourself, anyway.  I should also mention thatthey sell a kit for the black and white vector monitors, too,specifically for the Electrohome G802/805 series which is "get well kit#104".  They sell kits for most of the monitors that are/were commonlyused in the industry; I cannot recommend Zanen and their kits highlyenough.This is a good way to go if you don't feel like doing any testing tofind out what exactly is bad.  If you replace all the parts included inthis kit, you may be throwing out a lot of parts that still work OK (butwhich may be on their last legs, anyway), but you will be virtuallyassured of having a working monitor when you are done.  If you get themall in and it still doesn't work, then go through the flowchart shownlater in this document.  It is quite likely that you have a bad HVtransformer and you will have a heck of a time locating a replacement (Ihave a few but they won't last long) :<Be aware that some of the parts that Zanen will send you are from theoriginal spec and should not be used as this spec is known to bedeficient.  Consult the section below about how to upgrade thedeflection boards and switch out the indicated parts for the upgradedreplacements.Here are some good parts places to get the big transistors (and otherthings) that I've used before:Allied Electronics; 800.433.5700Digi-Key; 800.344.4539Mouser Electronics; 800.346.6873Newark Electronics Chicago; 708.495.7740Mouser also has the coin door "type 47" bulbs.  Here are a few surplustype places that I've ordered from that have great prices on things likeelectrolytic capacitors that will be happy to send you a catalog:All Electronics; 818.904.0524Marlin P. Jones; 407.848.8236Before we get started let me clear up something that causes a LOT ofconfusion when working on monitors of all types.  All the documentationand boards for these monitors refer to "X" as the longer axis and "Y" asthe shorter axis, independent of how the monitor is oriented in yourgame.  Confusion arises because the game PCB will refer to "X" as theaxis parallel to the floor and "Y" as the axis perpendicular to thefloor and this is dependent on how your monitor is oriented.  Why isthis important to distinguish?  Well if you notice that there is ahorizontal line on your Tempest screen and you go to figure out why youaren't getting any "Y" deflection, you must check the "Y" portions ofthe vector generator circuitry on your game PCB but you need to checkthe "X" portions of your monitor (deflection board)!Some words of caution about the manuals.  I've got 3 versions of TM-183(originals of the 1st and 2nd printings both from 1981 and a photocopyof the 3rd printing from 1982; let me know if you have an original ofthe 3rd printing that you'd be willing to sell).  Also, if you are luckyenough to have a copy of the Wells-Gardner service manual for thismonitor, the parts list on page 31 has an error; it lists C916 as .35uFwhen it is really .035uF.  It is labeled properly in the schematic onpage 28.  None of the manuals show all the different versions of thismonitor.Since the 3rd printing is uncommon, I will describe the significantdifferences from the 2nd printing (not noting the layout changes such asreplacing the crummy photographs with clear, sketched, exploded-viewdiagrams and minor rephrasings that are sprinkled throughout).  Allfigures show later versions of all boards with the exception of Figure13 which still shows the old deflection board (even though the partslist and everything else refer to the newer versions; obviously amistake).  Section 3 (Adjustable Controls) describes a later version ofthe neck board (P328).  Section 5 (Purity, Convergence, and TrackingAdjustments) is completely rewritten and is MUCH less vague and morecomplete (2 pages longer).  Section 6 (Details of Operation) has asection which discusses the Input Protection Circuit and has a schematic(Figure 8), too.  There is also a new section G (Over-VoltageProtection) which describes the new circuit in the later version of theHV unit (P324).The 3rd printing fixes some typos in the deflection PCB parts list:"(R606, 706)" split off to "4.7K Ohms, +/-5%, 1/4 W Resistor (R606)".

I also recentlydiscovered a small cache of replacement deflection boards labeled P339so there may be a whole 33X series, too!  To add to the confusion, theWells-Gardner service manual for "19K6400 series color vector monitors"shows a P341 version of the neck board, a P324 version of the HV unit,and a P322 version of the deflection board; I have never seen any ofthese versions.Here is how to identify the versions of the boards that I have seen.The deflection boards are P314, P327 and P339.  Some P314s were upgradedmost of the way to P327s with a small piggy-back PCB on wire "stilts" atthe top of the PCB (see "Input Protection Circuit", described later inthis document).  The neck boards are P315 and P328 (P328 has abrightness adjustment in one corner) and the HV power supply boards areP316 and P329 (P329 has an LED, HV limit pot, and an extra electrolyticcapacitor, C22, which is supposed to be 10uF at 63V).  After much verydisturbing feedback about the performance of the monitors, Atari had allthe boards redesigned to be more robust.  The P32X (and P339) versionsare the newer versions of the boards.A close inspection of the P339 deflection boards reveals that they are,in reality, P327s with a P339 sticker covering the part number!  I haveverified that the PCBs are identical but have noticed several (possiblynot all) differences between components on the 2 versions.  Make thefollowing changes on your P327, put a new label on it and you will havea virtual P339!  All other components except for the diodes (didn'tcheck them because they are too hard to read but it is extremelyunlikely that any are different) are the same.Differences between P327 and P339 deflection boards:C800-803 changed from .47uF @ 35V to 1uF @ 50V. (*)R701 (1.3K) changed from +/-2%, 1/4W to +/-1%, 5W. (*)R812-813 (1/4W) changed from 10K +/-5% to 5.6K +/-10%. (*)Q604/Q704 (NPN) packages are upgraded from TO-92 to TO-202 (NTE49). (*)If you have a P314 board, in addition to the changes listed above, youshould upgrade the following parts.Differences between P314 and P327 (P339) deflection boards:"Input Protection Circuit" added (see additional text later on).R106 (22 +/-10%) changed from 2W to 3W.Q101 (PNP) changed from Type MPSA56 (TO-92) to NTE50 (TO-202). (*)F100, 101 (Slow-Blow) changed from 5A to 6.25A.(*) The Zanen "Get Well Kit" uses the original specs and does notinclude these upgrades.Since the circuits are essentially the same and since I have used 5 Ampfuses in P339/327 boards without any problems, it is safe to say thatyou can (and more importantly, probably should) put 6.25 amp fuses inyour P314 boards at those 2 locations.The very first run of P314 deflection boards had design defects in themwhich were evidently identified after the PCBs were produced but beforethey were populated (I make this assumption because I have never seen aboard which did not have the corrections/substitutions on it).  Anywaysif your board says "85X0147" at the top then it is from the very firstbatch.  Later batches say "85X0147C" (I have never seen an "A" or "B"flavor).  The "C" flavor has C605 (.001uF +/-20%, Type-Z5F capacitor) inthe upper right corner but since the plain flavor doesn't have a spotfor it, it was soldered piggy-back onto R602.  Some boards use a .005uFcapacitor instead but you should change this to a .001uF if you have thesoldering iron out anyway.  The plain flavor has ZD100 labeled as R104and ZD101 as R105, respectively, even though there are always Zenerdiodes in those spots regardless.A comparison of the P315 and P329 versions of the HV PCBs and theirdocumentation yields several conflicting differences which aresummarized below.  The values marked with an asterisk (*) are the ones Isuggest you use regardless of which PCB you are working on (with thecaveat that the resistors should be "matched"; don't just change thevalue of one without changing the values of all the others.  Thecapacitor changes can be made individually).  If you use all theasterisk marked values, you will upgrade your P315 to a P329 except thatyou, obviously, won't have the over-voltage protection portion of P329.+-------+--------------------------------+--------------------------+|Part # | Value in document or on PCB    | Document/PCB referenced

units and they areall connectorized.  In other words if you have one working monitor youcan try the boards from your bad monitor (one at a time) even if theboards are not exactly the same.  Also, the most often failingcomponents are common to the different versions of the boards.  If youhave a vector monitor based game, it is really worth the effort andmoney to have a spare monitor handy (even if it is being used in anothervector game) so that you can isolate exactly which board is bad when(not if) you have a failure.Obviously, the neck board must be physically switched to be tested butyou you don't have to unscrew the ground wires of the current PCB, orscrew in the ground wires of the replacement PCB; you can just let thecurrent PCB dangle and use alligator clips to connect the replacementneck board's ground wires to the chassis.  With careful placement youcan test a deflection board or HV unit without having to remove the onealready in there.  For the replacement HV unit simply connect the 3connections and then use an alligator clip to ground the case to thechassis.  Since you have grounded it, there is no need to attach it tothe chassis; simply let it dangle by the secondary anode wire (the onewith the suction cup) or the alligator clip but make sure it doesn'ttouch anything it shouldn't (keep the exposed underside of the PCB fromtouching anything).  The replacement deflection board can sit on top ofthe current one separated by a piece of cardboard or othernon-conductive material but getting it in there is more hassle thanswapping so I usually pull the one that is in there and do a swap.NOTE:  There is 1 small exception to this universal compatibility rulefor the neck board PCB.  The P328 version uses a third (purple) wirerunning from the innermost (normally unused) pin of connector J501 topin 8 of J900 on the HV unit.  Without this wire, the new brightnesscontrol on P328 is disabled.  Also, and this is *VERY* important, if youare using a P328 PCB on a P315 wiring harness (or vice-versa), you haveto turn the J501 connector upside down.  Don't worry too much aboutremembering the orientation because the connector's pins are gappeddifferently so it will only fit onto each PCB one way (the right way)without severely bending the pins on the neck board PCB (i.e. it isidiot-proof).  This means that for testing purposes, you can swap boardsand everything will be fine but if you want the functionality that theP328 potentiometer provides, you must remove the associated wiringharness that connects to J501 along with the board (or else add a newwire to the existing harness on the destination monitor).  Without thiswire, a P328 will behave exactly like a P315 and the pot will donothing.The very first thing you should do is check all the fuses in the machinewith a meter.  There are 4 on the deflection board and most Atarimachines have 7 more in the power supply at the bottom of the machine (6in a bay on the left and one under a black cap on the right).  Rememberto check resistance on the fuse *holder* NOT ON THE FUSE.  Many times afuse will meter out OK but it isn't making good contact with the fuseholder so it is not conducting.  If you always put your probes on thefuse holder, you will never get tricked by a bad contact.  Many timesfuses not conducting can be made to do so merely by reseating them afterpinching the fuse holder clips tighter.  Sometimes the clips arecorroded and need to be cleaned first.  The wire contacts connecting tothe fuse holders may also not be conducting properly so you may want tomove your leads and test there to cover all your bases.  This ruleapplies to fuses in general anywhere you find them.The only other components (besides the tube itself) are the six largeTO-3 package transistors mounted to the chassis ("package" refers to thephysical description of the transistor, *NOT* the electricalcharacteristics).  The 3 NPNs are 2N3716s and the 3 PNPs are 2N3792swhich are all in the final stages of the deflection amps or the powersupplies.  The deflection amps are like an audio push-pull amplifier andto power these amps the monitor takes AC in and produces plus and minusDC voltages.Most of the failures in this monitor (as is the case with mostelectronic devices) are semiconductor failures, specifically, thetransistors.  All transistors discussed in this document can be testedin the same way; it doesn't matter if they are the large chassis-mountedtransistors or the tiny PCB-mounted transistors.  With the transistorsout of circuit, set your multi-meter on Rx1K scale and use the followingprocedures.NOTE:  ANALOG AND DIGITAL MULTI-METERS REQUIRE DIFFERENT TESTINGPROCEDURES FOR TRANSISTORS!  For some reason, digital meters always showinfinite resistance for all 6 combinations (if you accidentally get yourskin involved it will show something around 2M Ohms).  The best way totest transistors with a DMM is to make use of the "diode test" functionwhich will be described after the analog test.  For both methods, if youread a short circuit (0 Ohms or voltage drop of 0) or the transistorfails any of the readings, it is bad and must be replaced.TESTING TRANSISTORS WITH AN ANALOG OHMMETER:For type NPN transistors, lead "A" is black and lead "B" is red; fortype PNP transistors, lead "A" is red and lead "B" is black (NOTE:  thisis the standard polarity for resistance but many multi-meters have thecolors reversed; if the readings don't jive this way, switch the leadsand try it again).  Start with lead "A" of your multi-meter on the baseand lead "B" on the emitter.  You should get a reading of 2.5K Ohms.Now move lead "B" to the collector.  You should get the same reading.Now try the other 4 combinations and you should get a reading ofinfinite Ohms (open circuit).  If any of these resistances is wrong,replace the transistor.  Only 2 of the 6 possible combinations shouldshow a resistance and that value should be 2.5K Ohms; none of theresistances should be 0 Ohms (shorted).TESTING TRANSISTORS WITH AN DIGITAL MULTI-METER:Set your meter to the diode test.  Connect the red meter lead to thebase of the transistor.  Connect the black meter lead to the emitter.  Agood NPN transistor will read a JUNCTION DROP voltage of between .45vand .9v.  A good PNP transistor will read OPEN.  Leave the red meterlead on the base and move the black lead to the collector.  The readingshould be the same as the previous test.  Reverse the meter leads inyour hands and repeat the test.  This time, connect the black meter leadto the base of the transistor.  Connect the red meter lead to theemitter.  A good PNP transistor will read a JUNCTION DROP voltage ofbetween .45v and .9v.  A good NPN transistor will read OPEN.  Leave theblack meter lead on the base and move the red lead to the collector.The reading should be the same as the previous test.  Place one meterlead on the collector, the other on the emitter.  The meter should readOPEN.  Reverse your meter leads.  The meter should read OPEN.  This isthe same for both NPN and PNP transistors.

The following descriptions are relative to the monitor orientedhorizontally on it's base (like a TV would sit and like it is insidemost games) and viewing it from the back side (so that you see thecomponents and not the picture).  2 of them are on the outside of thechassis on the right side.  The one nearest the back (component) side isQ606; the one nearest the front (viewing) side is Q605.  On the insideof the bottom of the chassis are the other 4.  The one on the far leftnearest the HV unit is Q706.  The one on the far right nearest the first2 is Q103.  The other of the 2 remaining middle ones which is closest tothe back is Q102 and the last one which is in the same area but iscloser to the front of the monitor is Q705.An easy way to remember which kind of transistor goes where is to knowthat each connector has one of each kind; the 2N3716s are on pins 1, 3,and 4 (key at pin 2) and the 2N3792s are on pins 5, 6, and 7.  If thewiring has not been altered, all 2N3716s are connected to the yellow,green, and red wires and all 2N3792s are connected to the purple, blue,and white wires.  Here are 2 diagrams of the layout as viewed from thetop:+--------------------------------------------------+---------------------+|             (front; Picture Tube)                |                    /|                  2   _                           |  2   _            /|                  N  / \                          9  N  / \          /|                  3 / Q \                         0  3 / Q \        /|                  7| 705 |                        |  7| 605 |      /|                  1 \   /                         d  1 \   /      /|                  6  \_/                          e  6  \_/      /|      2   _                            2   _      g 2   _       /|      N  / \                           N  / \     r N  / \     /|      3 / Q \                          3 / Q \    e 3 / Q \   /|      7| 706 |                         7| 103 |   e 7| 606 | /|      9 \   /                          9 \   /    | 9 \   / /|      2  \_/                           2  \_/     b 2  \_/ /|                  2   _                           e       /|                  N  / \                          n      /|                  3 / Q \                         d     /|                  7| 102 |                        |    /|                  1 \   /                         u   /|                  6  \_/                          p  /|                                                  | /|                   (back)                         |/+--------------------------------------------------+or, more simply (where 2=2N3792 and 6=2N3716):            _________________           /      FRONT      \          |   Picture Tube    |          |-------------------|          +-----+   6  +-----+6          |HV   | 2    |Def.2||          |Cage |   6  |PCB  |2          +-----+------+-----+-These transistors often go bad and here is a quick lesson on how tocheck a transistor with a meter.  Unplug the red plugs from thedeflection board to isolate the transistor from the circuit.  From thebottom of the transistor, the configuration is (Oh boy; time for apicture!):          _         / \base -> /o o\ <- emitter       |     |        \   /<- the case is the collector         \_/Pretty crude but you get the idea I hope.  Test the transistors asdescribed earlier, one by one, by placing the multi-meter leads on thetops of the pins of the red connectors or on the transistors themselves.Neither method requires the removal of the transistor from its socket sodon't bother.  You do, however, need to disconnect the associatedconnector from the deflection board prior to testing.So what symptoms go with what?  Well if only one of the deflectionamplifying transistors goes then you will lose the corresponding half ofthe screen (for example if Q705 went bad in a Tempest game, you would bemissing the top half of your screen).  It won't actually be gone; itwill be collapsed into a line across a 0 axis of the screen.  If morethan one goes or either of the power transistors (Q103 or Q102) goes youwill get no picture because the spot killer turns on (and the LED on thedeflection board lights) and shuts down the electron beam.Checking these transistors is one of the first things you should do ifparts of your screen are missing or your spot killer is on.  Exactreplacements are nice but I've successfully substituted othersespecially if you put the nonstandard transistors in the place of Q102 &Q103 as those two are for the + & - power supplies and not as critical(image-wise) as the ones that drive the deflection coils.When replacing these transistors, make sure the socket is centered.Don't forget the little rubber or clear mica (plastic) insulator thatwas stuck to the chassis or to the bad transistor you just removed.  Youneed to grease this insulator on both sides with a special grease calledSilicone Heat Sink Compound.  It is not strictly necessary but helpstransfer the heat from the transistor to the chassis so the transistorslast longer.  The grease is pretty expensive so you may want to just buynew insulators (they should be about 10 cents each) because most come"pre-greased".Don't be nervous about remembering the orientation; the pins are offcentered in order to make the connection somewhat idiot-proof (seeearlier ASCII picture.  They are obviously "handed" but can be put inupside-down; it is a tight fit and hard to do but possible).  Also,after you replace these and before you power the game up, use your meterto make sure none of the cases of the transistors are shorted to thechassis.  This is very common and will cause fuses to blow and willprobably destroy the transistor.  If any part of the transistor istouching the chassis you are asking for trouble.On the deflection board, the most common failures are Q100 and Q101 andwhen these go they take R100 and R101 (respectively) with them.  Thesetransistors are part of the + & - power supply circuit and are often badwith the resistors really burnt.  To properly test these, they should bedesoldered and removed from the PCB.  Even in-circuit and not isolatedfrom other components you can still get a pretty good idea with amulti-meter (analog meters work best since digital meters show infiniteresistance most of the time) if the transistors are bad as transistorstend to fail catastrophically.  In other words, they usually completelyshort (0 Ohms) or open.  If you see 0 Ohms where there should be an opencircuit or 2.5K Ohms, then the transistor is probably shorted.  If yousee greater than 2.5K Ohms when the reading should be in that range thetransistor is probably open.  When these transistors are bad, theyusually show a large crack in the case if you look closely at them.Replace Q100 with the same type transistor but if Q101 is bad (and evenif it is not), I *strongly* suggest you upgrade it to a largertransistors that will handle more current.  I *ALWAYS* replace Q101 witha TO-202 package instead of the much smaller TO-92 package that theboard comes with.  In fact, the P327, and P339 versions weremanufactured with this upgrade.  The 3 labels I have seen are 119;NSDU57(National Semiconductor) and M152;126-1A ("brandless"?), and NTE50 (NTE)[semi-colons denote a new line of text found underneath the previousline].  I always use NTE50s as they are relatively cheap and very easyto find.Even though these transistors (and resistors) are the most commonfailures on the deflection board, I have *never* seen them go bad afterQ101 was upgraded to a NTE50.  If you can't find the generic parts, acommon modern day replacement for MPSA06 (Q100) is NTE287 and a commonmodern day replacement for MPSA56 (Q101) is NTE159 (but I cannot stressenough the utility of going with the larger replacement for Q101).Upgrading Q101 is always the first thing I do to any deflection board Iget; replacing it before it fails saves me from having to replace theother parts that go bad when it does fail.Once in a while you will see D105 or D104 open or shorted, too.  Alsowatch for broken solder joints at the base of the connector pins for allthe major connectors (especially on the deflection boards of black andwhite Wells-Gardner units which almost always are bad).  You tend torock the plugs back and forth when you pull the connectors and thisoften cracks the solder joints to the circuit boards which were poorlysoldered to begin with.  You may also want to check each pin forcontinuity with the next component on its trace line (and also withadjacent pins), and remove and resolder any dubious connections.  Whileyou are at it, resolder the 3 pins of the PTC thermistor (in the middlealong the left edge of the deflection board) as they are almost alwaysloose for some reason.It is unusual but sometimes some of the 4 heat sinked (or is that "heatsunk"?) transistors on the deflection board will die.  If any of theseis bad, you will usually get no picture at all but you will see"background brightness" that lets you know some electrons are beingthrown at the tube.  Be sure to check the resistors and diodes aroundany bad transistors you find.Usually, the electrolytic capacitors are still OK (though always besuspicious of electrolytics drying up and loosing micro-Farads).  If thetransistors in the chassis are OK, most missing pictures are due toproblems with this board (whereas most distorted pictures are due to badcapacitors in the HV unit).  I frequently see HV units with theprotective shield removed from the case and discarded in attempt to keepit cooler.  I like to keep mine on because I rate dust and foreignobject attraction as a more severe problem than heat for this board butlike I have said, I don't let my stuff run hot.Very infrequently, you may have problems with some other transistors inthe X/Y amp section of the board.  Most of the rest of the transistorsthat populate the deflection board (Q600-602,700-702) are type TPS98 andare not easily found anymore.  The good news is that TPS98 is equivalentto the PN3569 and the ECG or NTE 194.  All Electronics (800-826-5432)has PN3569 transistors at 5 for $0.50.  Note also that All has justdropped their minimum order requirement (still $5 S&H on most orders,though).The neck board very seldom has problems.  The few I've seen are frommishandling where someone has broken some of the pots that control theRGB drives.  Check the pots if you are missing a color.  If you areblowing your 5A fuses and your other boards are OK, check C503 (33 uF@ 250V).  If this is open, shorted or cold soldered, it will cause the5 (or 6.25 depending on your board) fuses to blow.Last is the HV supply.  I've worked on lots of these and have only seenone of the infamous bad HV transformers.  Normally HV failures are dueto a semiconductor or capacitor failure.  I must mention that the HVunit can put out very weak X-ray radiation and and creates lots of ionsin the air but both are in sufficiently small quantities that there islittle risk of injury.  Nonetheless, many people feel a tad queasyduring or after working near high voltage.  Like anything else, it getsless noticeable with successive exposures.  Many people are quiteworried the first time they experience the sensation but it is harmless.Please note that I am not a doctor nor a radiation specialist so referback to the CYA clause at the beginning of this document.  Certainunlikely faults that I have never run across could cause large amountsof X-rays to be produced which would definitely be harmful.Before you work on this beast, discharge the tube as it can really zapyou even when turned off (it is extremely inadvisable to work on the HVsection while the machine is on or even plugged in; always unplug thegame before you go in here).  Connect a clip lead between the chassisand the shaft of a long narrow plastic-handled screwdriver.  Work theend of the screwdriver under the big suction cup on the top of the tubeuntil you hit metal.  There will often be a snap (from the spark) as theHV runs at around 20 thousand volts.  Just go slowly and use only onehand.  It won't bite as long as you are careful.  You may want to leavethe game plugged in BUT TURNED OFF for this step so that you can groundto the earth instead of just the chassis.  If you plan to remove the HVunit, you must disconnect the secondary anode from the tube which is alittle tricky.  Under that suction cup is a double-barb.  The barbsextend perpendicular to the wire as it enters the suction cup.  Simplypinch the suction cup as best as you can and wiggle it back and forthwhile pushing in at the edges and pulling out at the center.  It willeventually come off.  Here is a cut-away depiction of the anode; thewire will run perpendicular to this view (i.e.  towards/away from thereader):                         |    /\   /\    |                          \     \ /     /                           \____|_|____/When I was in the habit, I discharged the tube with my HV probe so Icould watch the voltage go down as the internal resistance of the probebled the voltage off slowly.  If the snap bothers you, put a resistor inseries with your clip lead to drain off the voltage more slowly.  If youdon't have this equipment available, a 1 or 2 hour wait after unpluggingthe game should be sufficient for most of the excess charge to bleed offnaturally.  NOTE:  The anode is designed to hold onto charge so it will*never* discharge completely without being deliberately grounded.  Infact, if you wait a couple of days after grounding it, it will actuallybuild up another (small) charge!  I suggest that if you go through thetrouble of discharging it, you should keep it grounded by using analligator clip on the end of your wire and leaving it connected to yourground.  This way you have no chance of getting shocked (just beABSOLUTELY CERTAIN to remove this ground wire before you turn the powerback on again).Personally, I never worry about any of this anymore since the shock(when received properly) is harmless and mostly painless (I have gottenzapped dozens of times).  Just make sure the game is unplugged first.If you aren't going to wait, follow the "1 hand rule"; only use one handwhen disconnecting the cable and keep the other one in your pocket or inthe air.  The only likely way for the charge on an unplugged machine tohurt you is for it to form a circuit between your 2 hands (one groundedand one on the tube) sending current directly across your heart; theselevels could easily interfere with your heartbeat and even cause it tostop!  I should also point out that black and white monitors usesignificantly lower high voltage than do color monitors and rastermonitors have high voltages that are and order of magnitude higher thanvector monitors use.  I have been shocked by them all and assure youthat rasters *definitely* have a bigger sting than do vectors so beware!The following flowchart is excerpted from a photocopy of a photocopy(of a...)  which has no visible attribution or copyright.

Just because your symptom matches somethingin here is no guarantee that what I/he found wrong is the same thingthat is wrong with your board, but it's a good place to start.  Most ofthe problems he listed in his notes were due to manufacturing defects orincompetent repair work.  Obviously, if your monitor was working OK andthen simply stopped, those things are not likely be your problem.  Ifyou have seen any problems that are not listed in this section, pleasecontact me and I will add them.Display "implodes" during intermission screen between player one andplayer two and sometimes on the "figure 8" levels (Tempest machinesonly):  I thought I knew what was causing this but upon furtherevaluation, my solution didn't make sense (although it did work for methe only time I had this problem).  Until I get another board to fixthat has this problem, I only have general advice on how to avoid theproblem.  Adjust your game board and "shrink" the Y deflection some andthis should help.  There are 2 sets of ROMs for this game and the"compact" ROM set (only half the ROM sockets are used) is slightlydifferent (the intermission screen has some other stuff such as thecopyright and credits information at the bottom of the screen which"balances" it out) so the spot killer won't get confused and decide thatthe bottom half of the screen is wiped out.  These PCBs do not normallyexperience this difficulty.The following section lists problems with the deflection board.Fuses F100 and/or F101 are blowing as soon as game is powered up:  Thishappens to a lot of people after they replace the chassis transistors.Sometimes they forget to put the mica (plastic) insulator on thetransistor before installing them which allows the transistor's case(collector) to short to the chassis (ground).  A short can be presenteven if the insulator was installed if the conditions are just right.Check all chassis transistors, particularly Q102, Q103, to make sure thecases are not shorted to the chassis.Spot Killer LED lights and you don't have any display on the screen atall:  Check the fuses first.  If they are OK, then check the 6transistors mounted on the chassis as described earlier.  If you find atleast 2 of the deflection ones or 1 of the power ones bad, then that isdefinitely tripping the spot killer.  A good trick to figure out wherethe problem exists is to turn your brightness up all the way and seewhat your picture looks like.  The spot killer doesn't turn the Z signalall the way off so if you turn the brightness all the way up, you shouldbe able to see a very faint picture.  Based on what the picture lookslike, you can decide which half of the circuit is causing the problem(either the X or Y portion).  If you know it is a problem on yourdeflection board (i.e. swapping another board in makes the monitorwork) then check R808 (X) and R809 (Y) to make sure they are not open.These resistors allows current to flow to the spot killer circuitry andif they open then the spot killer thinks something has happened to theamplifier circuitry so it kicks on.  You can tell if this is yourproblem by turning the brightness on all the way; if you see a completepicture, then this may be your problem.  If all this is OK then youprobably have a game board problem, particularly if you are unable to"play" the game (see the credit lights blink after you punch up creditsand hear the game sounds after you push start).Zanen kit installed but still no picture (spot killer may or may notlight):  The problem is most likely Q603.  Occasionally you will seeQ603 (Q703), or Q604 (Q704) go bad.  If one does, be sure to check theresistors and diodes around it, particularly R611 (R711), R612 (R712),and D602 (D702).  A common modern day replacement for MPSU57 (Q603/Q703)is NTE189 and the part for MPSU07 (Q604/Q704) is NTE188.  These shouldbe greased where they touch the heat sink (like the chassis transistors)to improve heat dissipation.  If you are having trouble with thesefailing, you might want to beef them up by using TO-202 package upgradesto NTE50 (MPSU57) and NTE49 (MPSU07).No X (or Y) deflection:  I have seen 1 board like this and the problemwas that R710 (R610 for Y) was open.  How you fry a 10 Watt resistor andnothing else in the circuit is beyond me; perhaps the PCB was droppedand it landed on R710.  Anyways, you can test it in circuit and if youdon't see a virtual short then replace it.Jeff Young from World Wide Distributors in Grand Rapids, MI reportedsome words of caution about these resistors on Page 3 of the November1982 issue of the Star*Tech Journal:================================================================================After fighting a problem in the Atari "Tempest" for three days andfinding a silly mistake, I thought I should write to you.  Wells_GardnerMonitors #19K6101 use a 1.5-ohm 10-watt resistor in location R610-R710.If you replace these resistors with standard wire-wound units, themonitor will exhibit the "shakes" or "jitters" referred to in S*TJ, VOl.4, No.  7 "Service Tips", but the symptoms will be misleading in thatR601 and R701 must be *Non-Inductive*.  Please tell your readers aboutthis problem as Atari and Wells do not point out this requirement in theparts listing, and only put down the initials, "N.I" on the schematic.================================================================================R101 glows red hot and burns up to open circuit every time the game ispowered up (known good deflection board; works in good monitor):  Theresistor is burning up because of runaway current from the HV unit.  Youcan confirm this by replacing R101 and testing the deflection board in aknown good monitor (or by putting a known good HV unit in the monitorthat is acting up); if R101 doesn't burn up then you know the HV unit isthe culprit.  Whenever this has happened to me, R903 in the HV unit hasbeen the cause.  It will sometimes short and this causes so much currentto flow to the deflection board that the puny 15 Ohm resistor burns up.If this goes on for too long, Q101 may fail or occasionally R901 willburn up to an open circuit.Accidentally shift P101 over 1 pin and power up machine:  Although mostof the connectors/connections are idiot-proof, P101 is not (due to thepoor placement of the key pin as the *last* pin).  It can be connectedshifted over 1 or more pins to the right (although it should be obviousif you shift it more than 1 pin).  After shifting it 1 pin and fryingthe PCB, when you hook it up correctly, the spot killer LED will glow at50% brightness and you will get no video.  The following parts will needto be replaced; Q703, R711, D702, and C703 (C703 should be OK butreplace it just in case if you can find a new one).  Some caps may haveblown on the HV board, too.Distorted image which exists ONLY in the lower right quadrant of thedisplay:  I have seen this several times and the problem has always beena bad ZD101.  Much of the time this causes R101/Q101 to fry and spotkiller comes on.The following section lists problems with the neck board.Color problems:   Colors drop in and out; ZD500 (open; neck board)   Display is too bright;      R515 (broken wire to R531; neck board)      C503 (reversed; may toast R527; neck board)   No red; check:      on neck board:         R500 (open)         R502 (shorted to nearby component)         R510 (open)         R511 (open or wrong value)         R520 (open; red color can be seen but is very weak)         R529 (open or wrong value)         broken wire at R517 control   Only red; check:      on deflection board:         D802 (reversed)   Red too bright; check:      on neck board:         R501 (wired wrong)         R504 (open)         Q500 (collector shorted to base)   Red does not turn off when dimmed all the way; check:      on neck board:         Q500 (reversed or broken wire)         R513 (shorted to C500)         R519 (open)         R529 (open)   No green; check:      on deflection board:         neck board connector wrong type         broken green wire from deflection board to neck board      on neck board:         R503 (open)         R513 (wrong value)         R520 (wrong value; was 22)         R530 (open)         Q501 (bad or base shorted to emitter)         broken wire at R513         jumper from R511 to R513 missing   Only green; check:      on neck board:         Q503 (reversed or wired wrong)   Green too bright; check:      on neck board:         Q501 (collector shorted to emitter)   No green + blue is red; check:      on neck board:         R500 (shorted to R529 or shorted to R502)   Green is red; check:      on neck board:         R502 (shorted to R500)   Green does not turn off when dimmed all the way; check:      on neck board:         R512 (shorted to nearby wire or connecting wires wrong)         R519 (connecting wires wrong)         R520 (open)         Q501 (reversed, open, shorted, or broken wire to base)   No blue; check:      on deflection board:         D803 (bad) or neck board connector wired wrong)      on neck board:         R504 (wrong value)         R515 (open or wrong value or broken wire or swapped with R505)   Only blue; check:      on deflection board:         red lead in neck board connector broken   Blue does not turn off when dimmed all the way; check:      on neck board:         R504 (open)         R521 (open)         R522 (open)         R529 (open)         Q502 (reversed, emitter open, or shorted to nearby component)The following section lists problems with the High Voltage board.The image is extremely shaky and unstable and lines that should bestraight have periodic wiggles along their length that make them looklike an EKG (the distortion is sort of like when you watch TV with a badantennae and lines "walk" around on the screen):  Replace C901, C902,and/or C905 in the HV supply.  If of these is bad then the rest of theelectrolytic capacitors are probably in pretty poor condition too, so Igenerally replace all of them.  Make sure the replacements are rated atas least as many "working volts DC" WVDC and have as least as manymicro-Farads.  It doesn't hurt to replace a 22uF @ 50V capacitor with a50uf @ 100V if that is all you have around.  More Voltage capacity isequal or better but it is best to keep the capacitance the same if youcan.  Also when ordering and replacing these, be aware that they arepolarized and not idiot-proof; be sure to put them in the circuit sothat they are oriented properly.  The casing will clearly indicateeither the negative or the positive terminal (but typically not both)and the industry convention is for the positive lead of the capacitor tobe longer than the negative lead.  Be aware that P329 has an extracapacitor (C22) that may not be shown in your manual; its value is 10ufat 63V.If the picture is overly bright and all parts check out OK, look for abroken circuit board trace between pin 6 of the high voltage transformerand the anode of diode D901.  This trace is prone to breaking open.  Itis probably easier to just add a jumper and see if it solves the problemor else check the connection (with board removed) with a meter to makesure it is a short.If R925, R919, and R917 are smoked, check:   Q905 (shorted; T901 primary may be shorted, too)If R901, R907, R903, are smoked and Q902 and ZD901 are shorted, check:   Q901 (reversed)If you are blowing the top off Q901, check:   R902 (open)   Q900 (inserted or wired wrong; if emitter shorted to base then Q901,         Q902, and ZD901 get fried)   Q901 (shorted)   Q902 (shorted)   ZD901 (shorted)If you are blowing the top off Q902, check:   Q901 (reversed)If R901 and R907 are smoking, check:   Q902 (shorted)   Q906 (red and white leads interchanged)If just R901 smokes, check:   Q906 (inserted wrong)   Q900 (missing spacer or black lead open)If R903 smokes, check:   Q900 (shorted; will short ZD901, Q901, and Q902, too)IF R904 smokes, check:   Q902 (shorted)If R907 smokes, check:   C902 (reversed)   broken wire near R902If R908 smokes, check:   Q900 (white and black leads interchanged)If R912 smokes, check:   C910 (reversed)   D901 (wrong value; perhaps ZD902)If R917 smokes, check:   Q905 (reversed)If R920 smokes, check:   C913 (bad; this can damage T901, too)No High Voltage (HV); you don't hear the crackling sound when you firstturn the monitor on:  Check the transistors in the HV unit as describedearlier.  The ones I've seen fail most often are Q903, Q902, and Q901though they are all suspect.  These transistors will usually have cracksin the casing if they are bad so look closely at them.  If all thisstuff is OK, look at the electrolytic capacitors (they are the bigcylindrical tube-like parts and are usually blue in color) in thecircuit.  They come in two "types":  +---+             +---+                   |   |axial-lead --|   |-- and radial-lead |   |             +---+                   +---+                                      | |One quick errata:  The parts list in Figure 15 of TM-183 lists allcapacitors as fixed axial-lead when in reality only C905 is; the othersare all radial-lead.  These are designed to burst open when they faildue to overburdening (but they sometimes don't) so as to be obvious torepairpersons.  The top (for radial-leads) or the side (for axial-leads)will be open and some of the "guts" will be hanging out.  When somecapacitors go bad, they sometimes take the final output resistors R901and/or R907 with them (but the resistors will look perfectly OK unlessyou check them with a meter).  Also check to make sure that connectorJ901 inside the HV unit is intact; on person reported that the plasticin his disintegrated on the inside and the wires came loose.  If theseare OK, check the following:   waveform at IC901 outputs; if missing check:      R914 and/or R927 (wrong value)      R916 (broken wire)   waveform at Q906; if missing, check:      R926 (open)      Q906 (white wire open)      Q905 (emitter open)   waveform at Q905; if collector wrong, check:      Q906 (broken black lead or broken wire at emitter)   waveform at R921; if wrong, check:      Q906 (white and black leads interchanged at socket)   IC901; if no input voltages then check:      Q900 (red and black leads reversed)      ZD901 (check voltage drop)      ZD900 (shorted)   IC901; if input voltages present then check:      R914 (may be open; will cause waveform at C911 to not be X1K range)   C911 (open)   C915 (open)   C916 (open)   R901 (open)   R904 (open)   R905 (open)   R913 (open)   R923 (open)   R924 (open)   Q900 (shorted; +25 line is grounded by this)   Q904 (reversed, open, or missing)   Q905 (reversed or collector wire broken)   IC901 (defective, reversed, or unseated pins)   T901 (pins unseated or primary winding shorted)   Broken wire at R913   Broken wire at R919   Broken wire at base or collector of Q905   Broken wires or pins at P900   White wire disconnected at Q900   Red wire disconnected at Q906If you are also blowing any fuses, check:   C910 (reversed)   R907 (open)   R913 (shorted)   D902 (wrong value)   Red and white wires interchanged at Q906F600 blows immediately on powerup: Replace R612 if open.Blooming/"weak" brightness/Low HV:  Most of you don't have a HV probebut the most common symptom of low HV is that the screen looks as thoughyou are looking at the center through a magnifying glass.  This visualsymptom is known as "blooming".  I've seen several times where ZD902(150 volt Zener diode) goes bad and the HV drops from 19.5 kilovolts toaround 10 kV.  It's kind of like the electron beam moves slower withless HV giving the deflection magnets on the yoke more time to deflectthe beam (but what is really happening is that there is not enough HV tostrip all of the electrons off of the phosphor coating which causes thescreen to develop a negative charge which then deflects new electronswhich are expected to be hitting a screen with no charge on it).  A newZD902 and everything is better.  NTE5100A is a common modern dayreplacement for this part.  If ZD902 is OK, check the following:   R915 (open)   R922 (open or wrong value)   Q900 (emitter pin open)   Q902 (bad)   Q906; white and black leads reversed (scope pattern is wrong)   ZD901 (shorted)   IC901; if scope output is a little high, replace IC901   P900 (ribbon pin #7 broken)High voltage range wrong (normal is 16-24 kV); range is:   ??.?-12.0; Q902 (reversed).    7.0-10.0; ZD902 (bad)    7.0-17.0; ZD902 (bad)    7.0-22.0; Q903 (bad)    9.0-18.0; ZD902 (bad)   11.0-22.0; ZD902 (bad)   15.0-18.0; ZD901 (wrong value)   16.0-19.0; ZD902 (bad)   18.0-27.0; ZD902 (bad)   19.0-27.0; R912 (wrong value)   21.7-30.5; C916 (open)   28.0-20.0; C916 (bad)High voltage control has no effect; value is always:   7.4;  Q903 (collector wire shorted to HV control wore)   7.7;  Q903 (reversed or base and collector interchanged)   8.0;  Q903 (reversed or base and collector interchanged)   11.0; Q902 (reversed)   12.0; IC901 internal frequency changed by ZD902 (bad)   13.0; Q902 (reversed) or C920 (open) or ZD902 (bad)   16.0; Q900 (black and white wires interchanged)   17.0; ZD901 (shorted)   18.0; ZD902 (bad)   22.0; Q900 (reversed or black and white wires interchanged)   24.0; R912 (open) or Q900 (black and white wires interchanged)   27.0; R902 (open; this burns Q901, Q902, and ZD901)   28.0; broken wire at Q902   30.0; R915 (open)   32.0; ZD901 (bad) or R918 (open) or Q902 (collector lead open)Here is a really strange one about a problem with the tube itself!Focus starts out sharp but slowly gets fuzzy and then suddenly snapsback into clear focus (repeat every 10 seconds; eventually will stay outof focus all the time):  I didn't see the problem until I extended thewiring harness out of the back of the machine so the monitor was sittingon a stand, because there *was* arcing occurring, but it was *inside*the picture tube socket.  There's a white, cubic lump attached to theend of the neck (where the neck board attaches) where all the pins areand I could see a faint glow out of it when the monitor freaked.  Thefocus line from the HV power supply connects to the pin nearest thecube.  Inside of it, a sort of spark gap is implemented by running thefocus wire under and in contact with a small metal plate (the wireeventually connects to the socket pin).  A second formed wire issuspended above the metal plate with the point of a V bend in the wireforming a spark gap with the metal plate; this formed wire is connectedto chassis ground.  Its purpose is to form a spark gap with certain pinsin the socket; the intent is to prevent damage to the gun of the CRTduring power down.  In my case, the focus wire had lost good contactwith the socket pin, and some internal arcing of some sort appeared tohave released the metal plate from where the plastic housing wassupposed to retain it, causing the spark gap to become too small.  So itappears one problem led to another.  The connection to the focus pin ofthe picture tube socket had become intermittent.  Some arcing caused thebuilt in spark gap to come apart.  A similar problem with the samesymptoms can develop causing a dead short to ground of the focuselectrode.  Within the socket, there is a plate in the back of thesocket which is grounded.  If any moisture or conductive crud gets inthere, you can get a low resistance path between the grounded plate andthe focus pin.  To fix it, you have to desolder the socket and break itopen.  The socket simply pries apart but it was originally staked, sodon't be alarmed if you see small pieces of plastic flying off when youpry the sucker open.  I found it went together tightly enough that Iwasn't concerned about it falling apart but you could use a touch ofglue just to be sure.  I soldered the metal piece to the focus wire,placed it back in its retaining channel, cleaned out the gap area andsoldered the socket back in place.  The part that comes off the bottomof the socket to gain access to the internals touches the PC board whenthe socket is installed, and is retained just fine when the socket is inplace without gluing.All the above is assuming you just plug the game in and it doesn't work.If you happen to be playing the game at the time it fails, you have alittle more information to go on.  If you hear a loud bang like afirecracker, then check the capacitors on the HV board first becausethey can be loud when they burst.  If you see a little bit of smokeinside the cabinet and smell a hint of "electrical smell", then checkthe fuses first.  If you see a ton of smoke inside the cabinet, thencheck the large transistors on the chassis first.  If you start losingquadrants of your screen intermittently than I would advise replacingthe corresponding transistor before it fails because it can take othercomponents (usually fuses) with it when it goes altogether.  The sameadvice goes for the blooming caused by ZD902.Now some things besides the monitor itself.  Tempest is harder on thismonitor than the other Atari vector games.  The attract mode thatdisplays "TEMPEST" (often burned right into the phosphors) reallystresses the monitor.  For Tempest, I like to do what Atari did whenthey offered the Major Havoc conversion.  Add a fan to the back door ofthe game.  I try to find a small cooling fan that just moves a smallamount of air (not one that howls).  You have to cut a hole in the backdoor and position it so it directs air at the deflection board.  Iusually connect the power for the fan to the wires that head up to thefluorescent light and put a connector in so that you can still removethe back door (with the fan mounted on it) without it hanging on thewires to the fan.If you would like to greatly reduce your chances of experiencing amonitor failure in your Tempest machine, you may want to "shrink" thescreen in both axes using the X and Y "SIZE" pots on the game board.  Ialso have heard Tempest was bad, because it draws a diagonal retraceline (Z/brightness off) from the bottom left corner to top right cornerduring the attract mode.  There was supposed to be a ROM fix, which tookthis line out and really helped the transistors but I've never seen it.I could probably buy it, as it was supposed to have been pushed for by alocal operator.All of this has assumed that you had a good logic board in the game andthe monitor was receiving the vector info.  If the spot killer stays onand the monitor seems OK verify the presence of the X and Y signals bymeasuring between ground and pin 7 of the big white connector for the Xsignal and pin 8 for the Y signal.  This is an AC signal and if eitheris missing the spot killer circuit is just doing it's job and saving thetube's phosphors.You might also want to check that you don't have static analog data(voltage) saturating your transistors.  To check this, set yourmulti-meter on the DC voltage scale and measure the voltage on the leadof R600 and R700 which are connected to the yellow and orange wires,respectively.  The correct voltage should average out to about 0 voltsDC but will fluctuate (both positive and negative) because of thechanging deflection signal.  If the measured voltage is constant(between 5 and 15 volts positive or negative DC) then check the X and Yamplifiers on the game board.Now that you have a working monitor (and game), it is time to fine tuneyour picture.  Before making any adjustments, turn your game on and letit warm up for at least 10 minutes.  R918 is the HV adjust and my adviceis that unless you have a HV probe, don't mess with it.  If you have aprobe, set the HV for 19.5 kV with zero beam current (i.e. with thegame boards disconnected from the machine so that no input signals arebeing supplied).Some HV supplies (P329) have a circuit called the HV over-voltageprotection circuit.  It monitors the voltage of the focus assembly inthe secondary circuit of T900.  If the high-voltage at the anode of thepicture tube increases beyond the threshold set by H.V.  TRIP adjustmentR930, this circuit shuts off the timer of IC901 and LED D903 turns on toindicate the over-voltage condition.  Presumably, this was added to helpdiscourage Tempest from eating HV transformers as it is prone to dosince they are by far the most expensive component in the game.  AdjustR930 so that it is just beyond the point where LED D903 lights (so thatthe LED is off).NOTE:  The following adjustments are a 2 person job (unless you are veryhandy with mirrors) because it is nearly impossible to view the screenand turn the pots at the same time.  When adjusting your monitor, alladjustments should be made in the order as presented below as many ofthe adjustments have effects on other qualities and will cause you tohave to go back and redo them if you change the order.On the outside of the HV assembly are focus and brightness adjustments.Adjust the focus until the picture is sharp then adjust the brightnessjust under the point where the dot in the center starts to show or justunder the point where you can see the connecting lines between objects.Be careful to not get carried away with the brightness as you can dopermanent damage to the phosphors.The manuals don't talk much about adjusting the positioning and size ofyour screen but that is easy to do.  There are small potentiometers onthe game board that are clearly labeled which control X and Y centeringas well as X and Y size.The following adjustments refer to the 8 tiny blue and/or blackpotentiometers found on the large game board towards the back on aTempest machine.  If your lines are not meeting at the "joints" properlyor your text and numbers aren't lined up properly on the statisticsscreen then you need to make these adjustments.  This information isdirectly from the Tempest schematic diagram supplements (sheet 2, sideB, 3rd printing) so locations/numbering/labeling of the pots may bedifferent for other vector games but the instructions should berelatively portable...================================================================================[NOTE:  Atari did copyright these documents and they are clearly markedwith a copyright symbol.][NOTE:  All of the following controls exist in the Vector Generatorsection of the game PCB; THEY ARE NOT IN THE MONITOR!]+------+        +------+        +------+|/\/\/\|        |  |   |        |  |   ||\/\/\/|        |  |   |        |  |   ||/\/\/\|        |  |   |        |  |   ||\/\/\/|        |---   |        |--+---||/\/\/\|        | -----|        |  |   ||01..YZ|        |   |  |        |  |   ||\/\/\/|        |   |  |        |  |   |+------+        +------+        +------+screen I        screen J        screen KEnter self-test and advance screens to the diagonal crosshatch pattern[the one with the line of numbers and letters at the bottom; screen I].Adjust "CENTER" pots:  Adjust X-CENTER (R147) and Y-CENTER (R167) sothat the pattern is located at the middle of the screen.Adjust "SIZE" pots:  Adjust X-SIZE (R150) and Y-SIZE (R168) so that thepattern exactly covers the whole visible screen.Adjust the "BIP" pots ["BIP" stands for "Bipolar" but I don't know whatthat means...]:  Adjust the X-BIP (R118) and Y-BIP (R117) so that thecorners of the diagonal lines rest exactly on the sides of the outerrectangle.  [NOTE:  It may be easier to advance to the screen with thesingle large cross-hair on it to make the BIP adjustments; just makesure the lines meet at exactly the center.  Using this screen, youshould try to make screen J look like screen K.  Be careful when joiningthe lines in the middle that you don't overlap; it is *very* hard tonotice this.  I suggest you make a big gap (go the wrong way) and thenconverge until the 2 segments just touch.  Screens J, and K were addedby me and are not shown in the original document.]Adjust the "LIN" pots:  Adjust the X-LINEAR (R169) and Y-LINEAR (R165)so that the diagonal lines are straight.  Since the "LIN" pots changethe size of the displayed picture on the screen, you may have toreadjust the "SIZE" pots in order to get the correct adjustment.================================================================================Here is a summary of the white balance adjustment sections of TM-183.This is paraphrased and abridged since the information was spread outover many boring pages.  You should make these adjustments before youadjust the purity and convergence.  Do not do it in reverse orderbecause color changes do slightly impact those other adjustments.================================================================================Flip the test switch inside the coin door on the top near the hinge(some games may have the self-test switch mounted in a different areasuch as on a plate near the top of the coin box).  Tempest requires youto rotate the spinner until the prompt reads "Press Fire and Zap forSelf-Test".  Other games may have similar requirements to get to theself test screens or they may take you directly to them automatically.Do whatever is required to enter the self test screens.Advance the screens with the slam (a.k.a. "tilt") leaf switch (this istypically inside the coin door below the lock) until you get to thediagonal crosshatch pattern screen (see "screen I" in the next section).For Tempest this should be the 1st screen.Turn the focus control (one of the 2 white knobs on the HV unit) untilyou get the optimum screen sharpness possible.  Your goal is the bestcharacter appearance without appreciable fuzziness.Advance the screens until you get to one showing 7 groups of coloredbars of various intensities.  For Tempest this should be the 5th screen.Turn all the potentiometers on the neck PCB to the full clockwiseposition.  Turn the brightness control (the other white knob on the HVunit) so that only 5 lines are visible and 6th one is completelyinvisible.  Adjust the red, green, and blue bias potentiometers (theblack ones) until the 5th line from the right is pure white without anyhint of color in it (the 5th line is the dimmest one and color biasabnormalities are most visible at lower brightness levels; the goal isto get all 5 lines to be completely white).  Adjust the red, green, andblue drive potentiometers (the white ones) until the 1st line on theright is pure white.  Repeat the bias adjustment if the 5th line fromthe right is no longer pure white.================================================================================As far as adjusting purity (red gun hits red phosphors only, green gunhits green, etc.)  and convergence (red, green, and blue guns hitadjacent dots to make white instead of separate colors), that is a wholedifferent subject and the manual does a decent job of walking youthrough the procedure.================================================================================Here is the associated information from the Wells-Gardner Service Manual:COLOR PURITYFor best results, it is recommended that purity adjustment be made withdisplay unit facing west or east.  The display unit must have beenoperating 15 minutes or more prior to this procedure.With yoke on CRT neck, set convergence assembly on CRT neck with thecenter line (of Purity Adjustment Magnet) over gap between grids No. 3and No. 4.  The convergence assembly consists of 3 sets of ring magnetswith tabs (Figure 6).-------------------             +-----------+  \             /       /-+     |===========| <- Purity Adj. ////////////////======|  |     |===========| <- Red/Blue Adj.

Refer to "INTERFACE BOARD ADJUSTMENTS" for input signallevel and pattern size.With a green crosshatch pattern, pull the deflection yoke backward asfar as it will go.  The center vertical portion will be green.  If greenis not horizontally centered between other colors, move the 2 puritymagnets with respect to each other in order to center green crosshatchon the screen.Push deflection yoke forward gradually, until crosshatch is a uniformgreen (pur in color) across the entire pattern.  The deflection yokeshould be secured in place.Both red and blue colors are to be checked for uniformity and truecolor.  Reposition the deflection yoke, if necessary, to obtain optimumpurity of all colors.  Tighten clamp to secure deflection yoke.STATIC CONVERGENCE ADJUSTMENT4-Pole Magnets and 6-Pole Magnets are for static convergence.1.  A crosshatch signal should be connected to the monitor.2.  A pair of 4-Pole Convergence Magnets is provided and adjusted to    converfe the blue and read beams (Figure 6).  When the Pole opens to    the left and right 45 degrees symmetrically, the magnetic field    maximizes.  Red and blue beams move to the left and right.    Variation of the angle between the tabs adjusts the convergence of    red and blue vertical lines.3.  When both 4-Pole Convergence Magnet Tabs are rotated as a pair, the    convergence of the red and blue horizontal lines is adjusted.4.  A pair of 6-Pole Convergence Magnets is also provided and adjusted    to converge the magenta (red + blue) to green beams (Figure 6).    When the Pole opens to the left and the right 30 degrees    symmetrically, the magnetic field is maximized.  Red and blue beams    both move to the left and right.  Variation of the opening angle    adjusts the convergence of magenta to green vertical lines.5.  When both 6-Pole Convergence Magnet Tabs are rotated as a pair, the    convergence of magenta to green horizontal lines is adjusted.ADJUSTMENT OF DYNAMIC CONVERGENCE (Figures 7, 8 and 9)[NOTE:  This text refers to a monitor oriented in the proper horizontalposition.  Some games such as Tempest use the monitor rotated 90 degreesinto the vertical poisition.]1.  Feed crosshatch signal to the monitor.2.  Insert a wedge temporarily and fix the Deflection Yoke so as to    obtain the best circumference (Figures 8a through 9b).  NOTE:  The    wedges may need to be moved during adjustments.3.  Insert three rubber wedges to the position as shown in figure 7 to    obtain the best circumference convergence.NOTE:1.  Tilting the angle of the yoke up and down adjusts the crossover of    both vertical and horizontal red and blue lines (Figures 8a and 8b).2.  Tilting the angle of the yoke sideways adjusts the parallel    convergence of both horizontal and vertical lines at the edges of    the screen (Figures 9a and 9b).3.  Use three rubber wedges (tapered rubber wedges are used for thie    purpose.)4.  The position of each rubber wedge is shown in Figure 7.5.  Do NOT force the permanenet wedges in.  They are to be inserted    until they just make contact with the yoke - after the yoke ahs been    positioned.6.  Fix the three permanent rubber wedges with chloroprene rubber    adhesive.7.  After the adhesive has dried enough to hold the wedges in place,    carefully remove the temporarily installed wedge.          _         | | <---------- Temporarily Installed Wedge      ___|_|___ /\  /_________\  /\/  \//         \\/  \ <- Rubber Wedge\  //           \\  /    (60 degrees from Temporary) \// +---------+ \\/ //  |   ___   |  \\||   |  /   \ <--------- CRT Neck||   | |     | |   ||||   |  \___/  |   || \\  |         |  //  \\ +---------+<------- Deflection Yoke   \\           //    \\_________//     \_________/         | |         |_|     FIGURE 7 (Rear View)+---------------------------+|        B    G    R        |  Insert rubber wedge|         \   |   /         |  from upper (right for|          \  |  /          |  Tempest) side|  R___     \ | /     ___B  |      ||      ---___\|/___---      | S V  v|  G----------*----------G  | I I    / \    /|      ___---/|\---___      | D E   /   \  /|  B---     / | \     ---R  | E W  / DY  \/|          /  |  \          |     /      /-----+|         /   |   \         |     ------/------+|        R    G    B        |          /+---------------------------+         /          FIGURE 8A+---------------------------+         \|        R    G    B        |          \|         \   |   /         |     ------\------+|          \  |  /          |     \      \-----+|  B___     \ | /     ___R  | S V  \ DY  /\|      ---___\|/___---      | I I   \   /  \|  G----------*----------G  | D E    \ /    \|      ___---/|\---___      | E W  ^|  R---     / | \     ---B  |      ||          /  |  \          |  Insert rubber wedge|         /   |   \         |  from lower (left for|        B    G    R        |  Tempest) side+---------------------------+          FIGURE 8B+---------------------------+     TOP VIEW|+-------------------------+|        /\||+-----------------------+||       /  \  /|||                       |||      / DX \/|||                       ||| +-> /     /||||                       |G| |   -----/|||||                       B|R |       / |||||                       ||| |         ++|||                       ||| ||||                       |||  Insert rubber wedge||+-----------------------+||  from left (top for|+-------------------------+|  Tempest) side+---------------------------+          FIGURE 9A+---------------------------+     TOP VIEW|+-------------------------+|        /\||+-----------------------+||    \  /  \|||                       |||     \/ DX \|||                       |||     |\     \ <-+|||                       |G|     ||\-----   ||||                       R|B     || \       ||||                       |||     ++         ||||                       |||                ||||                       |||  Insert rubber wedge||+-----------------------+||  from right (bottom|+-------------------------+|  for Tempest) side+---------------------------+          FIGURE 9B================================================================================Now that you have your monitor repaired and adjusted, I'll discuss thevariety of ways that exist to make your monitor (or rather, yourdeflection board) more robust and hopefully reduce or eliminate futurefailures.Here is some text from the Major Havoc conversion kit installationinstructions (TM-268).

Set the display on a clean work surface.   2.  Disconnect the 15-pin Molex connector from the mounting bracket       on the display chassis and the harness connectors from the       Deflection PCB and the Neck PCB.   3.  Use a 1/4-inch hex driver to remove the two screws securing the       Deflection PCB to the display chassis [NOTE:  there are holes for       2 more screws in the remaining (rear) 2 corners of the board       which some users decided to fill; if the board won't come out,       check for this]   4.  Remove the Deflection PCB from the display.   5.  Connect two type-1N754A Zener diodes together, anode to anode,       as shown in Figure 6.  Use a soldering iron to solder the two       anode leads together.                 Solder Here                     |CATHODE +-+------+  \|/   +------+-+ CATHODE--------+ |1N75#A+--------+1N75#A| +--------        +-+------+ ANODES +------+-+        ----|<----        ---->|----Figure 6 IN754A and 1N756A Zener-Diode Connections[Figure 7, entitled "Modifying the Wells-Gardner Deflection PCB",showing 2 half scale pictures of the solder side of the Deflection PCB,has been omitted for obvious reasons.

Connect two type-1N756A Zener diodes together and solder as       described in step 5.   7.  Examine the soldered side of the Deflection PCB removed from the       display and determine which of the two PCBs shown in Figure 7       matches your PCB.   8.  On the component side of the Deflection PCB, locate the yellow       wire (top right side of the PCB).   9.

Solder the other cathode lead of the two type-1N754A Zener diodes       to ground as shown on the appropriate illustration in Figure 7.  11.  On the component side of the Deflection PCB, locate the orange       wire (near top center of the PCB).  12.  Solder one cathode lead of the two type-1N756A Zener diodes       (soldered together in step 6) to the orange lead on the soldered       side of the PCB as shown on the appropriate illustration in       Figure 7.  13.  Solder the other cathode lead of the two type-1N756A Zener diodes       to ground as shown on the appropriate illustration in Figure 7.  14.  On the component side of the Deflection PCB, locate connector       P600 (right center of the PCB).  15.  Solder the cathode lead of a type-1N4002 diode to pin 1 and the       anode lead to pin 4 of connector P600 on the soldered side of the       PCB as shown on the appropriate illustration in Figure 7.  16.

As far as Iknow, these are present only on versions P327 and P339of the Deflection PCB (which have the Input ProtectionCircuit redesigned into the board).  This question couldprobably more easily be phrased, "Is your board labeledP327 or P339." The fact that they chose not to word thequestion this way implies that there are some boardredesigns which were labeled P314 instead of P327.  Theproceeding 3 descriptions refer only to (most butperhaps not all of) the various flavors of the P314version of the Deflection PCB (i.e. not P327 nor P339).]Input Protection Circuit PCB is installed (piggyback)        Version 2WITH A 1K Ohm, +/-5%, 1/4 W RESISTOR CONNECTED BETWEENTHE INPUT PROTECTION CIRCUIT PCB AND THE DEFLECTION PCB.[NOTE: I have documented this PCB immediately followingthis article.]Input Protection Circuit PCB is installed (piggyback)        Version 3BUT DOES NOT HAVE A RESISTOR CONNECTED BETWEENTHE INPUT PROTECTION CIRCUIT PCB AND THE DEFLECTION PCB.Deflection PCB DOES NOT HAVE CAPACITORS C804 AND C805        Version 4(BELOW TOP CENTER OF PCB) OR AN INPUT PROTECTIONCIRCUIT PCB INSTALLED.----------------------------------------------------------------------  21.

I have seen all in action and canverify them to be "non-lethal" modifications but cannot really attest totheir usefulness since I don't run my Tempest under stress.  I wouldadvise that you only implement 1 of them unless you are sure they arecompatible (I am not).  If anybody knows if any are compatible (or not),let me know.  For now, I am listing them as mutually-exclusive; mix atyour own risk.  I'd take the time and hassle to do the first one eventhough it is a lot more work.The Input Protection Circuit did not include any background in the kitso here are those details which I found on page 3 of the May 1982 issueof Star*Tech Journal:================================================================================NEW INPUT PROTECTION CIRCUIT FOR WELLS-GARDNER COLOR X-Y DISPLAYThis display contains an additional small printed-circuit board (PCB).The PCB is mounted in "piggy-back" style on top of the Deflection PCB.The input protection board was added to protect the fuses in the displayfrom damaging input voltage conditions.  Without this board, the displayfuses might blow in the event of an intermittent or long-term game PCBfailure.  With this board, the screen will momentarily go blank if theaverage X- or Y-axis voltage(s) exceed a certain level.  The screen thenautomatically recovers for normal game play and earning when thevoltage(s) return to normal.If this display is used in Atari "Tempest" games, be sure to correctlyadjust the X and Y SIZE and CTR video pots on the "Tempest" AnalogVector-Generator (main) PCB.  The instructions for the adjustments areprinted on the "Tempest" schematics - Sheet 2, Side B - 3rd printing orlater [and can also be found in this document].  Improper adjustment maycause the screen to go blank during normal game play.================================================================================Now onto the actual Atari document about the IPC.================================================================================[NOTE:  To my knowledge, Atari never bothered to copyright theseinstructions and they are not marked with a copyright symbol.][NOTE:  THIS MODIFICATION IS FOR P314 VERSIONS OF THE DEFLECTION BOARD*ONLY*.  The P327 and P339 versions already have this circuit designedinto the board.  Here is the text from Atari CO-183-02 (1st printing)which describes a circuit that was sold by Atari to help make thedeflection board more robust.  This circuit is unavailable but verysimple and easy to recreate from the schematics provided herein.][NOTE:  Martin Sterni <m-sterni@dsv.su.se> has successfully prototypedthese and is currently selling them WITHOUT ANY COMPONENTS.  He has sentme a few samples and they are of *superb* quality (nicer than theoriginal Atari/Wells-Gardner PCBs).  I can vouch for them being producedproperly in every way; I am very impressed!  Contact him if you want topurchase any.]NEW INPUT PROTECTION CIRCUITFOR WELLS-GARDNER COLOR X-Y DISPLAY(Supplement to TM-183)This display contains an additional small printed-circuit board (PCB)that is not described in the display manual (TM-183).

Later versions had a 1K Ohm, +/-5%, 1/4 W resistor as one ofthe "stilts" on the board instead of a plain piece of wire.  If yourboard does not have this resistor, here is what you need to do.   1.  Locate the "stilt" wire connected to resistor R1 (22K ohm) and       the collectors of transistors Q1 and Q3 (type 2N3904) on the       Input Protection Circuit PCB (the other end is connected to the       P314 Deflection PCB).   2.  Use a wire cutter to cut the wire, located in step 1, half-way       between the two PCBs.   3.  Use a soldering iron to solder a 1K Ohm, +/-5%, 1/4 W resistor       between the two ends of the wire cut in step 2.I have included this resistor in my ASCII rendering of the schematicand labeled it R'.================================================================================[NOTE:  Play Meter did copyright this article and the magazine isclearly marked with a copyright symbol.]Here is an article from the April 15, 1983 issue of Play Meter magazine(page 191) which is copyrighted material and is included withoutpermission; forgive me.  It is from a regular feature in the magazinecalled "FRANK'S CRANKS" by Frank "The Crank" Seninsky.HOW TO MAKE A 'TEMPEST' MONITOR TROUBLE-FREE.Atari's Tempest, when it is working, is not a bad game.  It's just ashame that the monitors only last a few weeks (sometimes only days)between service calls.  Most of the time, the monitor sits neglected ona techroom shelf.Atari has developed a monitor protection board [included earlier in thistext] to protect the monitor's components (2N3716 and 2N3792 "X" OUTputtransistors, two each located on chassis frame) if and when there is aRAM lock-up on the Tempest CPU board.  I want to clarify that theWells-Gardner monitor is not at fault.  Also note that on the laterAtari games, the protection circuit has been incorporated into the boardcircuitry.  [These statements seem to imply that this "fix" iscompatible with the Atari upgraded P314s as well as P327s and P339s andwill provide additional protection; if fact, I have seen it on a P327before.  It is sufficiently ambiguous that the exact opposite can beinferred.  Judging from the areas of the board it alters, I would say itis incompatible (duplicates) the other fixes in this section.]It's common knowledge that you can purchase a broken Tempest game cheap.With about 20 minutes of your time and a couple of dollars in parts, itis possible to add just six common components to the monitor deflectionboard and have a Tempest that will stay on location and work [Yeah,right]!The parts required are:   two-1N914 diodes   two-1N4737 diodes   two-1K OHM 1/4 W resistorsFIRST HALFTake the anode ends (the ends opposite from the marked rings) of a1N914 and a 1N4737, and solder them to one end of a 1K ohm resistor sothat it looks like this:                               ANODE +------+-+ CATHODE                            +--------+1N4737| +--------+ GROUNDCATHODE +-+------+ ANODE   /         +------+-+        |--------+ | 1N914+--------+                           ===  C700R700    +-+------+         \         +--------+        |                            +--------+ 1K ohm +--------+ -27 VOLTS                                     +--------+Locate C700 in the top left of the monitor deflection board.  (SeeFigure 13 on page 20 of Atari TM-183 Wells-Gardner Quadrascan servicemanual; second printing) and solder the cathode of the 1N4737 to theground side of C700 (right side in Figure 13).  Solder the end of the 1KOHM resistor to the -27 volt side (left side) of C700.  Solder the oneremaining wire (the cathode of 1N914) to the "X" INput side of R700 (topend of R700).  You are now halfway finished.HALF TIMETake a five-minute break; you deserve it.SECOND HALFTake the remaining 1N914 and 1N7437, and solder the cathode ends of eachdiode together with one end of the 1K OHM resistor so it looks likethis:             ANODE +------+-+ CATHODEGROUND    +--------+1N4737| +--------+          |        +------+-+         \ CATHODE +-+------+   ANODEC701     ===                           +--------+ | 1N914+--------          |        +--------+         /         +-+------+    R700+27 VOLTS +--------+ 1K ohm +--------+                   +--------+Locate C701 (top middle in Figure 13) and solder the anode of 1N4737 tothe ground side of C701 (right side).  Solder the end of the 1K OHMresistor to the +27 volt side of C701 (left side).  Go back to the same"X" INput side of R700 and solder the remaining wire (the anode of the1N914) to this connection.  Make sure that you have a good solderconnection at the "X" INput of R700 as you now have a three-wire joint.FINAL TWO-MINUTE WARNINGMake sure that none of the wires of this modification can come intocontact with the other board components [easy to do; there is lots ofbare PCB in this area; you may want to tape/glue the leads down],especially the brown ground wire located to the right of R700.  If themodification hits this brown wire, you can consider it a fumble and youjust blew your lead and the game.================================================================================Lastly, I will list 2 hacks that I have seen made to deflection boardsin an attempt to get them to work for longer periods in the field.  Ihave seen them on both the P314 and P327 designs.  The first one makessome sense but the second one is downright scary!Cut the trace just above pin 4 of connector P101 isolating the 3 topmostconnections (purple wire, R713, and pin 7 of P700) from the rest of thecluster.  Jumper the 3 isolated connections to pin 7 of P100.  Thismakes those 3 connections run at -33.3V instead of the usual -27.7V.Cut the trace just to the left of pin 3 of P101 isolating the 5rightmost connections (F700, R808, pin 5 of P701, C104, and R712) fromthe rest of the cluster.  Jumper the 5 isolated connections to pin 1 ofP100.  This makes those 5 connections run at 33.8V instead of the usual27.8V.I am not sure what is gained by biasing these portions of the circuit bylarger magnitude voltages but will look into it later.When I saw this next hack, I couldn't believe my eyes; especially afterI plugged it in and IT WORKED!  The hack described above was implementedbut with the following additions...Evidently this operator got so tired of fixing the low voltage powersupply regulator circuitry that he ELIMINATED IT FROM THE CIRCUIT!  Whathe did was remove virtually that entire section (R100-103, D104-105, andP100) and instead formed the voltages required by dropping theunregulated +/-33 voltages across resistors!  He connected a 10 Watt, 25Ohm (+/- 10%) resistor between pins 3 and 7 of P100.  An identicalresistor was connected between pins 1 and 4 of P100.  I'm not sure whatkind of solder he used but it is takes a good minute for a 30 Wattsoldering iron to even begin to melt a small portion of it.This change will give you a very noisy approximation of the originalvoltages that should be good enough to run the monitor.  Needless tosay, the ceramic resistors get unbelievably hot and the screen is alittle jumpy when drastic changes in drawing (current pull) occur (suchas between waves and during the demo) but other than that the resultsare quite tolerable.  If run for extended periods, this setup isvirtually guaranteed to blow some fuses on the deflection board.Since there is no longer a Q101 to worry about, it won't cause you anyproblems and since P100 no longer exists (either it or the connectorthat goes to it should be removed to avoid somebody plugging it in andadding the transistors to the now foreign circuit), there won't be anyproblems with Q102 and Q103 either (they are no longer required in thecircuit and the connector that went on the now missing P100 just hangsin the air).  If you are going to be placing one of these monitors outin the field or it is going to get frequent, extended duration use, thishack *might* be worth trying (assuming the degradation of picturequality is acceptable to the viewers) but I would think it would greatlystress the rest of the circuitry as well as the yoke coils and wouldlimit the lifetime of the unit in other, less familiar ways.  The PCB Isaw this on had extensive burns on the amplification portions of thecircuit which I almost never have to repair so BEWARE; this hack mayhave been the cause not the solution!
