Troubleshooting your Tempest Machine, by Gregg WoodcockThis article is Copyright worldwide 1991, 1995; all rights reserved.This is a file I have put together which should get you started onrepairing your non-working Atari Tempest game.  It lists all theproblems I have seen and lots of information from the various manuals.Monitor failures are much more common than game board failures (in fact,I find the game boards to be fairly robust) and that topic is so lengthythat it is covered in another file.  The last portion of this documentincludes the self-test instructions and DIP switch settings from themanuals so you might want to start there.Let me start out by stating that arcade games in general tend to have alot of problems with safety interlock switches which shift position ordeteriorate so that they no longer close all the way (to be fair to theinterlocks, sometimes it is the cabinet that warps pulling the engagingpanels away from the interlocks).  If you get no power at all and havechecked the fuses, make sure you check the safety interlocks to makesure they are all engaged and conducting.  Also check for breaks in thewall cord as these get a lot of yanking and abuse.  Replace the plug ifthe earth ground pin is broken off.  Another good idea when you aremaking repairs is to install high-quality sockets when you replace anyIC.  If it went bad once, it is likely to go bad again and you can savetime, effort and heat stress to the PCB by performing a solderlessreplacement the next time it goes bad.If you have a Tempest game board that doesn't seem to be working, checkto make sure the game isn't paused!  I have seen several boards come myway that were "broken" but merely had the pause switches set.  The gameinstantly "locks up" and you never get a picture or any response toinputs and the spot killer lights; all symptoms of game board failurewhich fools many people.  Before you assume you have a game boardfailure, be sure that switches 1, 2, 7 and 8 on the 8-toggle DIP swtichbank at location N13 are NOT set to Off, Off, Off and On, respectively;this combination is marked "Demonstration Freeze Mode" in thedocumentation and pauses the game.  As far as I know, no other Atarigame of any era has a pause switch in it but I wish they all did; it isvery handy for those marathon sessions when nature calls!The first thing to check when you have a known good monitor and a gamePCB that does not produce video is the adjustment potentiometers.  Irecently spent a whole weekend verifying the vector generator circuitryon a Tempest PCB only to find a hairline separation of the leftmost pin(when looking at the side of the pot with the dial) of R168 (Y SIZ).When this pin is floating, the spot killer kicks in and there is novideo at all!  When being improperly stored or transported, thesecomponents take a lot of abuse and are bent back and forth.  Too much ofthis and the legs simply break (usually only 1 at a time so it isn't allthat obvious).  Occasionally these cheap pots will simply go bad andfail to work (yielding a permanent 0 or infinite resistance) so youmight check their resistance range with a multi-meter even if all thepins are OK.  Simply replacing that 1 pot fixed my board.  Whenreplacing these pots, I lay them flat against (parallel with) the PCB tolower their profiles so that they stick out less.  This problem canhappen on any Atari vector game; black-and-white or color.The other common cause for a board with no video is a failure of theAM6012 digital-to-analog converters that feed the X and Y sections ofthe vector generator circuitry (1 chip for each signal).  If your gamehas scraggly vectors that start out OK but get messed up as the gamewarms up or if your vectors are totally trashed (particularly if it isonly in 1 dimension), you are probably observing the effects of a badDAC.  Of course if you let the symptoms continue, the DACs will failaltogether and you will have no video at all (since the spot killer willkick in).  The best way to check these is by using cold spray tostabilize the DAC.  If you spray the chip and the game clears up thenyou know that chip is failing (this works for any IC).  Otherwise youcould remove the old DAC and replace them with a known good DAC fromanother board (installing sockets in the process).  Similar videosymptoms can occur as a result of less frequently failing parts such asthe LF13201 analog switches and the TLO84 op amps.All Atari games of the early era were subject to bad solder joints andthis should always be the first place you start checking when you haveproblems.  I know for a fact that most of the monitor failures in thefield are not due to overheating (at least not directly) but due tolockups in the game board which cause the monitor to saturate andoverheat its semiconductors.  There are 2 boards that comprise theTempest board set.  The larger of them is about 2 feet long by 1 footwide and is known as the "vector generator PCB".  It contains all thegame ROMs, among other things.  The other smaller board is about 1 footsquare and is known as the "math box".The most common cause of lockups and resets is bad solder joints on theinterbaord connector that lets these boards communicate with each other.Whenever I get a new board set, I resolder these whether they look likethey need it or not.  The next most common cause is bad circuit boardedge connectors on the wiring harness.  If they are marginal at all, doyourself a favor and replace them!  They can be cleaned fairly well byspraying them with "tuner cleaner" (available at Radio Shack) and thenreseating the connector a few dozen times but this is only a temporarysolution because the real problem isn't so much dirt as poor tension dueto age and heat stress (and poor initial quality).  Similar problems arecommon with the fuse holders in the power supply, particularly F2.  F2is rated at 20 amps and ultimately feeds the +5 supply.  It can getoverheated and loose spring tension and this will cause resets.  Thiscan usually be fixed by cleaning and bending the clips tighter whichavoids having to replace the holders.Two of the socketed 40-pin chips on the math box (locations B/C2 andC/D2) are called "Audio I/O N-Channel MOS/LSI Custom Chips" by themanual but at least the schematics refer to them by their "real" namewhich is "POKEY".  The most frequent thing to go bad on the Atari mathboxes besides the ROMs are these POKEY chips.  The POKEY was designed bythe Atari home computer division for the Atari 400 computer.  It standsfor POt KEYboard controller and it has a sound generator, random numbergenerator, input buffering, and much more all on one chip.The symptoms of a bad POKEY are that control input or sound output isnot normal or missing altogether.  The POKEY in Tempest at B/C2 controlsthe spinner inputs so if your spinner is flakey and the opto-electronicscheck out (they frequently fail), this is probably your culprit.  Theself test should be able to confirm the diagnoses.  If you see a "P" or"Q" in the middle of the screen then one of the POKEYs is bad (see chartbelow).I like to order POKEYs from American Techna-Vision since you get anentire 40 PIN chipset intended for machines in the Atari 8-bit computerline.  Besides the POKEY, you get a GTIA, ANTIC, and PIA.  Order catalognumber AK675, "40 Pin Large Scale Integrated Circuit Chip Set".  On topof that they have the cheapest shipping, no minimum order (that I amaware of) and accept credit cards.  You can also scavenge POKEYs frominside of many Atari 7800 cartridges, most notably Ball Blazer althoughthey are also used in Commando and Summer Games and I suspect that DigDug, Dark Chambers and Jinks also have one.  The POKEYs are the chipsthat have the Atari part number "C012294B-01" on them.B & C ComputerVisions5917 Stope Wway El Dorado, Ca. 95623(530) 295-9270 FAX 9271E-mail myatari2@myatari.comWeb site: www.myatari.comatari pokey our part# ICA294 $5.eachshipping 1 to 100 $8.00Best Electronics        408.243.6950 (Atari POKEYs $5+$?

They are really 2901bit-slice ALUs, which were very popular and are fairly commonlyavailable.  They were made by AMD and a number of other vendors.  In atechnical sense the part really is a transistor array, but calling itthat serves no purpose other than obfuscation.  These go bad every nowand then and will generate an "M" on the self-test screen.  NOTE:  the"M" is a generic "M"ath box failure indicator and does not necessarilyindicate that an ALU is bad; lots of failures cause the "M" indicator toappear but one of the most frequent causes is bad ALUs.

SELF-TEST PROCEDURE     This game will test itself and provide data to demonstrate thatthe game's circuitry and controls are operating properly.  The data isprovided on the monitor and the game speaker; no additional equipmentis necessary.     Part 1 of the self-test procedure includes a display of theoperator-selectable game options, and game time and high score tableinformation.  Part 2 includes ROM and RAM, control panel and monitorinformation.     We suggest you run the self-test procedure any time you collectmoney from the game or any time you change the game's options.  Referto Figure 5 for location of the self-test switch and option switches.To run the self-test, follow the instructions outlined in Figure 6.Figure 5:  Location of Self Test Switch, Volume Control and OptionSwitches.  [NOTE:  I will not attempt to draw the pictures but willdescribe in detail what they show.  One shows the bottom of the front ofthe machine with the coin door wide open.  An arrow points to arectangular assembly which juts out into the from the *inside* of thecabinet located about 1/3 the way down the left side of the opening.There is a blow-up of this area which shows that this rectangle consistsof a volume control potentiometer which increases as you rotateclockwise and also shows a slide toggle self-test switch for Europeangames.  US games have the self-test switch in the standard location formost of Atari's early games.  Look in the very upper-right corner(towards the hinge) of the interior of the coin door and you will find aswitch with a long stem.  The last picture shows the location of thegame PCBs which are in the middle of the back of the machine mounted onthe right (looking from the back) side panel.  There are 3 DIP switchpacks on the big game board ("vector generator PCB") and 1 on the smallone ("math box").  DIP switch packs are located at K10/11 (4 switches),L12 (8 switches), and N13 (8 switches).  Together these 3 packs arelabeled "Options Switches".]SELF-TEST PROCEDURE PART 1     The information below is displayed on the screen if you set theself-test switch to on during the attract mode [i.e. after the game hasbeen turned on].  Look at the displayed numbers for SECONDS ON andSECONDS PLAYED.  If these numbers run together vertically, makeadjustments to the X and Y outputs of the game PCB [particularly theBIP controls].     To go to the Self-test Part 2, rotate the control knob until themessage PRESS FIRE AND SUPERZAPPER FOR SELF-TEST appears on themonitor.  Then press both FIRE and SUPERZAPPER.  To end the operatorinformation display, set self-test switch to off.                  +------------------------------------------+  TIME GAME                  |                                        /--- PLAYED (Seconds)   TIME GAME ON   |     PRESS FIRE AND ZAP FOR SELF TEST  /  |   (Seconds) ----------\                                 /   |  NO.

[NOTE:  If yourboard has EPROM 136002-117 at location J1 instead of 136002-217, youwill see a straight line that behaves like the second-hand of a watchrotating around one end in the same direction that you spin the controlknob instead of seeing the hexadecimal numbers 0-F.]The -217 EPROMremoves the high score backdoors.]TEST 3 FAILS:Incorrect [opposite] progression of numbers indicates encoder wheelharness wires were connected incorrectly.  No number change indicatesencoder wheel [optos] is bad or harness wires are loose [or POKEY isbad].Instruction 4:Observe the white frame around the outside of the screen.Test 4 passes:Each frame corner should be within 1/2-inch of each monitor bezelcorner.TEST 4 FAILS:See Tempest Drawing Package [or my other file on how to repair themonitor] to adjust video pots.Instruction 5:Activate SLAM [tilt] switch.Test 5 passes:A white cross hatch pattern appears.  A character set appears at thebottom of the screen.TEST 5 FAILS:If display is not centered and symmetrical on the monitor, adjust videopots (see Tempest Drawing Package [or my other file on how to repair themonitor]) on the main PCB.  If character set is incorrect, check VectorROMs (see Troubleshooting Guide).Instruction 6:Activate SLAM [tilt] switch.Test 6 passes:Horizontal and Vertical lines cross in the center of the screendisplaying a large "plus" sign.  Audio I/O 1 and 2 alternate to produce4 tones.TEST 6 FAILS:Lines not crossing indicates [BIP] video pot[s] on main PCB needsadjusting (see Drawing Package [or my other file on how to repair themonitor]).  No sound indicates failure of an audio amplifier and/or thecustom audio chip(s).Instruction 7:Activate SLAM [tilt] switch.Test 7 passes:Tests purple, cyan, yellow, white, green, blue, and red for color andintensity.  Displays seven groups of vertical lines, each with rightline the brightest and left line the dimmest.TEST 7 FAILS:Use this pattern for tracking adjustments (see the Color X-Y MonitorManual [or my other file on how to repair the monitor]).Instruction 8:Activate SLAM [tilt] switch.Test 8 passes:A checkerboard pattern touches the sides and corners of the monitor.Rotate the control knob to change color.TEST 8 FAILS:Use this pattern for purity and convergence adjustments (see Color X-YMonitor Manual [or my other file on how to repair the monitor]).Instruction 9:Activate SLAM [tilt] switch.Test 9 passes:A white frame is displayed on the screen.TEST 9 FAILS:Perform math-box signature analysis (see Troubleshooting Guide).Instruction 10:When satisfied with test, set self-test switch to OFF position.E. OPTION SWITCH SETTINGS1.  Bonus Play Feature     Tempest (TM) offers a bonus play for certain combinations of coinsinserted.  This bonus feature is operator-selectable, meaning you maychoose to offer it or not.     With your game set at 25 cents per play, players who deposit foursuccessive quarters or a $1.00 coin, then press the start button, canreceive a bonus play.  Therefore, players can receive 5 plays for $1.00.     This bonus feature encourages players to insert more money thanjust the minimum 25 cents required for one game.  Various other bonusesare also available (see Figure 8).From TM-190; 2nd printing:FIGURE 7 GAME OPTION SETTINGS     To change toggle positions on the switch assemblies, you need notremove the game PCB.  The switches are accessible when the Tempest (TM)Analog Vector-Generator PCB is mounted in place.  To change positions onthe Auxiliary PCB slide the board out as far as possible.     When changing the options, verify proper results on the monitordisplay by *performing the self-test*.  Note that changing an option onany of the following eight toggles will *not* cause an immediate changeon the monitor screen during the attract mode.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Settings of 8-Toggle Switch on Tempest Analog Vector-Generator PCB (at L12) 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   Option---------------------------------------------------------------------------                            On   1-credit minimum $                            Off  2-credit minimum                    On  On       English $                    On  Off      French                    Off On       German                    Off Off      Spanish                                 Bonus life granted at every:        On  On  Off              10,000 points        On  On  On               20,000 points $        On  Off On               30,000 points        On  Off Off              40,000 points        Off On  On               50,000 points        Off On  Off              60,000 points        Off Off On               70,000 points        Off Off Off              No bonus lifeOff Off                          2 lives per gameOn  Off                          3 lives per game $On  On                           4 lives per gameOff On                           5 lives per gameSettings of 4-Toggle Switch on Tempest Auxiliary PCB (at D/E2) N                               Game difficulty* O      On  On                   Medium $ T      On  Off                  Easy        Off On                   Hard U      Off Off                  Medium S E  On                           Minimum rating range: 1,3,5,7,9 $ D  Off                          Minimum rating range tied to high score---------------------------------------------------------------------------$ Manufacturer's suggested settings* Easy - Enemies move slower and one less enemy shot on the screen at         one time.  Hard - One more enemy, enemies move faster and 1-4 more enemy shots on         the screen at one time.For pricing for "credits," see Figure 8.Changing toggles 1-5 erases the high score table.FIGURE 8 GAME PRICE SETTINGS     The table below contains the switch settings for those optionsrelating to game price, coin mechanism multipliers, bonus play,demonstration and freeze mode.  This information is useful if you wantto view all 99 levels of play or freeze the action, if you need totemporarily set the Tempest (TM) game on free play, or if you haveGerman coin mechanisms in your door.     To achieve bonus plays, all coins must be inserted before pressingthe start button.  If you choose the two play minimum, set toggle 8 atPCB switch assembly L12 to *off*.     The Demonstration Mode** allows you to choose any level (1-81) inthe ready-to-play mode and accelerate through the tubes without havingto kill the enemies.  Freeze allows you to stop the action.  The scoreis zeroed at the end of the game in this mode.     Set the toggles per the table below for the Demonstration Mode.Next rotate the control knob.  You may choose level 1 through 81 duringthe ready-to-play mode.  Press either START button to accelerate throughthe tubes.  Press the FIRE button to clear the spikes at the bottom ofthe tube.  To freeze play, set switch 1 to off.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Toggle Settings of 8-Toggle Switch on Tempest    Analog Vector-Generator PCB (at N13) 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   Option---------------------------------------------------------------------------                        Off On   Free play                        Off Off  1 coin* for 2 credits                        On  On   1 coin* for 1 credit $                        On  Off  2 coins* for 1 credit                 On  On          Right coin mech x 1 $                 On  Off         Right coin mech x 4                 Off On          Right coin mech x 5                 Off Off         Right coin mech x 6            On                   Left coin mech x 1 $            Off                  Left coin mech x 2On  On  On                       No bonus coins $On  On  Off                      For every 2 coins*, game adds 1 more coin*On  Off On                       For every 4 coins*, game adds 1 more coin*On  Off Off                      For every 4 coins*, game adds 2 more coins*On  On  On                       For every 5 coins*, game adds 1 more coin*On  On  Off                      For every 3 coins*, game adds 1 more coin*             Demonstration and Freeze Mode**On  Off                 Off On   Demonstration ModeOff Off                 Off On   Demonstration-Freeze Mode---------------------------------------------------------------------------* In the U.S>, a "coin" is defined as 25 cents.
