If this were a classic car I'd say it's a daily driver. Mechanics are solid but has cosmetic issues.

The first picture shows good color but little detail.
The rest of the shots are outside in the sun which washes out the colors but shows all the flaws. There is a little burn of the skyline and just barely the 'Defend Cities' text.

New big blue cap in the power supply and no trouble with the PCB. Also have a new ball for the trackball (not installed).

It has the Braze kit on it to play Super Missile Attack and also save high scores for both games, and the rollers and bearings in the trackball are new. Has the correct pair of LED start buttons and the three non-LED black fire buttons.

If you want to go all out you can get a new CPO and side art for about $200 and you'd have it pretty minty.

Price: $475
