Major Havoc Return to Vax ROM's

Burn these five ROM's and place them at the specified locations. YOu will not get any speech
yet until I release the schematics for the parts placement on the board. That should be 
happening by the first of the year hopefully. There are not that many change until you get up 
to level 18 right now. So unless you are a dedicated Major Havoc fanatic like me, you may need 
some practice. If you have any questions email me at  Jess@magenta.com
