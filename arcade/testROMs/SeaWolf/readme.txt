Sea Wolf Test Program, version 2.0 9/26/2010

Free for personal use, but do not distribute without permission from
TheShanMan on the klov forums.

sw_test.716 is a bin file for burning a 2716 rom. Put it in rom location H,
and there is no need to remove the other rom chip.

seawolf.zip is for testing in mame - replace your seawolf.zip file and it will
run the test program.

Note: DIP switch #5 is not read by the processor, hence the "X" in the DIP
switch reading. It is simply a switch that's in series with the High Score
button, thus disabling the button in circuit.

Special thanks to Timothy Shiels at outerworldarcade.com for providing
commented source code for the Space Invaders test program.
